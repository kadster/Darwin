We had so much to talk over during my visit, that I could not fully explain to You how matter stands with Your other works. I would be extremely glad to share also any profits from Your former 4 vol. but unhappily till now I am a heavy loser by them. You will appreciate this seemingly strange fact by my saying that besides my complete Edition of Your Descent of Man, we have in Russia two pirated abridged edition of the same work selling at a very low price. We are not protected by a treaty and every successful book printed in England is sure to be published in an abridged and bad translation, which by its low price cuts entirely all profits of a good and complete Edition. By publishing the work “on Expression” shortly after the original there is a hope of preventing competitive and bad Editions, but still I must be prepared that after the book is out in England it will be translated and printed in a cheap form with some of the woodcuts made in Russia, and the whole book sold at 2/6 or 3s. However if profits will come, I and my brother will be very glad to share them. If You will allow me, I’ll call one day of the ensuing week, for a short visit, on You, and try to arrange this matter to our mutual satisfaction Your very truly | W. Kowalevsky"

DCP-LETT-2922.xml,1860-09-20,1860,"Darwin, C. R.","Weismann, A. F. L.","My dear Sir I have read your long letter with much interest & I thank you sincerely for your great liberality in sending it me.— But on reflexion I do not wish to attempt answering any part, except to you privately: anything said by myself in defence would have no weight; it is best to be defended by others or not at all. Parts of your letter seem to me, if I may be permitted to say so, very acute & original; & I feel it a great compliment your giving up so much time to my book. But on the whole I am disappointed; not from your not concurring with me, for I never expected that; & indeed in your remarks on Ch. XII & XIII you go so much further with me, (though a little way) than I ever anticipated & am much pleased at the result. But on the whole I am disappointed, because it seems to me that you do not understand what I mean by Natural Selection, as shown at p. 11 of your letter & by several of your remarks.—   As my book has failed to explain my meaning it would be hopeless to attempt it in a letter. You speak in early part of your letter & at p. 9. as if I had said that Natural Selection was the sole agency of modification; whereas I have over & over again, ad nauseam, directly said & by order of precedence implied (what seems to me obvious) that selection can do nothing without previous variability. see p. 80, 108, 127, 468, 469 &c “Nothing can be effected unless favourable variations occur”. I consider Natural Selection as of such high importance, because it accumulates successive variations in any profitable direction; & thus adapts each new being to its complex conditions of life.—   The term “Selection” I see deceives many persons; though I see no more reason why it should than elective affinity, as used by the old chemists. If I had to rewrite my book, I would use “natural preservation” or “naturally preserved”. I sh d . think you would as soon take an emetic as reread any part of my Book, but if you did & were to erase selection & selected & insert preservation & preserved, possibly the subject would be clearer. As you are not singular in misunderstanding my Book, I should long before this have concluded that my brains were in a haze, had I not found by published reviews & especially by correspondence that Lyell, Hooker, Asa Gray, H. C. Watson, Huxley & Carpenter & many others perfectly comprehend what I mean. The upshot of your remarks at p. 11 is that my explanations &c & the whole doctrine of natural selection are mere empty words signifying the “order of nature”; as the above named clear-headed men, who do comprehend my views, all go a certain length with me & certainly do not think it all moonshine, I should venture to suggest a little further reflexion on your part. I do not mean by this to imply that the opinion of these men is worth much as showing that I am right, but merely as some evidence that I have clearer ideas, than you think; otherwise these same men must be even more muddled headed than I am; for they have no temptation to deceive themselves. In the forthcoming September no r of the American Journal of Science there is an interesting & short Theological Arcticle (by Asa Gray), which gives incidentally with admirable clearness the theory of Natural Selection, & therefore might be worth your reading: I think that the theological part would interest you.) You object to all my illustrations: they are all necessarily conjectural, & may be all false; but they were the best I could give. The Bear case has been well laughed at, & disingenuously distorted by some into my saying that a bear could be converted into a whale; as it offended persons I struck it out in 2 d . Edition; but I still maintain that there is no especial difficulty in a Bear’s mouth being enlarged to any degree useful to its changing habits,—no more difficulty than man has found in increasing the crop of the pigeon, by continued selection, until it is literally as big as whole rest of body. If this had not been known, how absurd it would have appeared to say that the crop of a bird might be increased till it became like a balloon. (With respect to the ostrich, I believe that the wings have been reduced & are not in course of development, because the whole structure of a Bird is essentially formed for flight; & the Ostrich is essentially a bird. You will see at p. 182 of “Origin” a somewhat analogous discussion. At p. 450 of 2 d Edit. I have pointed out the essential distinction between a nascent & rudimentary organ.—   If you prefer the more complex view that the progenitor of the Ostrich lost its wings, & that the present ostrich is regaining them, I have nothing to say in opposition.—) (With respect to Trees on islands: I collected some cases, but took the main facts from Alph. De Candolle, & thought they might be trusted. My explanation may be grossly wrong; but I am not convinced it is so; & I do not see the full force of your argument of certain herbaceous orders having been developed into trees in certain rare cases on continent. The case seems to me to turn altogether on the question whether generally herbaceous orders more frequently afford trees & bushes on islands, than on continents, relatively to these areas.—) (In p. 4. of your letter you say you give up many Book-species as separate creations; I give up all, & you infer that our difference is only in degree & not in kind. I dissent from this; for I give a distinct reason how far I go in giving up species; I look at all forms, which resemble each other homologically or embryologically as certainly descended from the same parents.) (You hit me hard & fairly about my question (p. 483 Origin) about creation of eggs or young &c—(but not about mammals with mark of umbilical chord). Yet I still have an illogical sort of feeling that there is less difficulty in imagining the creation of an asexual cell, increasing by simple division.) (Page 5 of your letter,—   I agree to every word about antiquity of World; & never saw the case put by any one more strongly or more ably. It makes, however, no more impression on me, as an objection; than does the astronomer when he puts on a few hundred-million miles to the distance of the fixed stars. To compare very small things with great,—Lingula &c remaining nearly unaltered from Silurian epoch to present day is like the dovecot pigeons still being identical with wild rock-pigeons, whereas its “fancy” offspring have been immensely modified & are still being modified by means of artificial Selection.)—) (You put the difficulty of the first modification of the first protozoon admirably : I assure you that immediately after 1 st . Edit. was published this occurred to me; & I thought of inserting it in 2 d . Edit. I did not, because we know not in the least what the first germ of life was; nor have we any fact at all to guide us in our speculations on the kind of change which its offspring underwent. I dissent quite from what you say of myriads of years it would take to people world with such imagined protozoon.— In how very short a time Ehrenberg calculated that a single infusorium might make a cube of rock— A single cube on geometrical progression would make the solid globe in (I suppose) under a century. From what little I know I, cannot help thinking that you underrate the effect of the physical conditions of life on these low organisms. But I fully admit that I can give no sort of answer to your objection; yet I must add that it would be marvellous if any man ever could, assuming for the moment that my theory is true.—   You beg the question, I think, in saying that Protococcus would be doomed to eternal similarity:—nor can you know that the first germ resembled a Protococcus or any other now living form.—) (Page 12 of your letter. There is nothing in my theory necessitating in each case progression of organisation; though natural selection tends in this line, & has generally thus acted. An animal if it became fitted by selection to live the life, for instance, of a parasite, will generally become degraded. I have much regretted that I did not make this part of the subject clearer; I left out this & many other subjects, which I now see ought to have been introduced. I have inserted a discussion on this subject in the foreign Editions. In no case will any organic being tend to retrograde unless such retrogradation be an advantage to its varying offspring; & it is difficult to see how going back to the structure of the unknown supposed original protozoon would ever be an advantage.) (Page 13 of your letter. I have been more glad to read your discussion on “dominant” forms than any part of your letter: I can now see that I have not been cautious enough in confining my definition & meaning. I cannot say that you have altered my views. If Botrytis had exterminated the wild Potatoe, a low form would have conquered a high; but I cannot remember that I have ever said (I am sure I never thought) that a low form would never conquer a high. I have expressly alluded to parasites half exterminating game-animals: & to the struggle for life being sometimes between forms as different as possible, for instance between grasshoppers & herbivorous quadrupeds. Under the many conditions of life which this world affords, any group which is numerous in individuals & species & is widely distributed may properly be called dominant. I never dreamed of considering that any one group, under all conditions & throughout the world, could be pre dominant. How could Vertebrata be predominant, under the conditions of life to which parasitic worms live? What good would their perfected senses & their intellect serve under such conditions? When I have spoken of dominant forms, it has been in relation to the multiplication of new specific forms, & the dominance of any one species has been relative generally to other members of the same group, or at least to beings exposed to similar conditions & coming into competition. But I daresay that I have not in the Origin made myself clear, & space has rendered it impossible. But I thank you most sincerely for your valuable remarks, though I do not agree with them.) (About sudden jumps; I have no objection to them: they would aid me in some cases: all I can say is, that I went into the subject, & found no evidence to make me believe in jumps; & a good deal pointing in the other direction.—   You will find it difficult (p. 14 of your letter) to make a marked line of separation between fertile & infertile crosses. I do not see how the apparently sudden change (for the suddenness of change in chrysalis is of course largely only apparent) in larvæ during their development throws any light on this subject.—) I wish I could have made this letter better worth sending to you: I have had it copied to save you at least the intolerable trouble of reading my bad hand-writing. Again I thank you for your liberality & kindness in sending me your criticisms; & I heartily wish we were a little nearer in accord, but we must remain content to be as wide asunder as the poles; but without, thank God, any malice or other ill feeling.— My dear Sir | Yours very sincerely"

I feared you might be huffed for a little time with me; I know some men would have been so. I have hardly any more criticisms, anyhow worth writing. But I may mention that I felt a little surprise that old B. de Perthes was not rather more honourably mentioned.— I would suggest whether you could not leave out some references to the “Principles”; one for the real Student is as good as a hundred; & it is rather irritating & gives feeling of incompleteness to general reader to be often referred to other book.— As you say that you have gone as far as you believe on species-question, I have not a word to say; but I must feel convinced that at times , judging from conversation, expression, letters &c, you have as completely given up belief in immutability of specific forms, as I have done.— I must still think a clear expression from you, if you could have given it , would have been potent with the public, & all the more so, as you formerly held opposite opinion.— The more I work the more satisfied I become with variation & n. selection; but that part of the case I look at as less important, though more interesting to me personally. As you ask for criticisms on this head (& believe me, I sh d . not have made them unasked) I may specify (p. 412, 413) that such words as M r D “labours to show”—“is believed by the author to throw light”, would lead a common reader to think that you yourself do not at all agree, but merely think it fair to give my opinion.— Lastly, you refer repeatedly to my view as a modification of Lamarcks doctrine of development & progression; if this is your deliberate opinion there is nothing to be said—; but it does not seem so to me; Plato, Buffon, my grandfather before Lamarck & others propounded the obvious view that if species were not created separately, they must have descended from other species: & I can see nothing else in common between the Origin & Lamarck. I believe this way of putting the case is very injurious to its acceptance; as it implies necessary progression & closely connects Wallace’s & my views with what I consider, after two deliberate readings, as a wretched book; & one from which (I well remember my surprise) I gained nothing.

The wretched writer has not a glimpse what the discovery of scientific truth means.— How splendid some pages are in Huxley; but I fear the book will not be popular.

Your memory must be wonderfully accurate, for you know my works, as well as I do myself, & your power of grasping other men’s thoughts is something quite surprising, & this, as far as my experience goes is a very rare quality.

Now I am going to beg a favour. Will you provisionally give me permission to reprint your article as a 1 s . pamphlt. I ask only provisionally, as I have not yet had time to reflect on subject. It would cost me, I fancy, with advertisement some £ 28 or £ 30; but the worst is that, as I hear, pamphlets never will sell. And this makes me doubtful. Should you think it too much trouble to send me a title for the chance ? The title ought, I think, to have M r Mivarts name on it.

Dear Covington,— I was very glad to get your letter about six weeks ago, dated August 8, 1854, with so good an account of yourself, your affairs, and your children. You have exactly the same family which we have—five boys and two girls; but you beat me in being able to say that yours are all strong and healthy, which is hardly the case with mine, though none have anything serious amiss with them. How little you thought when we landed together at Sydney, that you should one day have land and house letting for £83 per annum. I am very glad to hear the Colony is progressing so well, and that, as you say, “our good Queen has not more loyal subjects in her dominions than are the Australians.” I have lately seen and heard news, more especially of the gold districts, from a Mr. Mackenzie, who was a schoolmaster at Sydney and afterwards a surveyor, has made a nice fortune, and, his wife dying there, he has come back with his one daughter to end his days here, and has published a little book describing Australia. But he seemed to regret Australia. I am sure this last winter, with six weeks’ frost, and with the thermometer sometimes at 0 o , is enough to make anyone past boyhood wish to be in a warmer and better climate. We were during this time in London, for we took a house for a month to have a little amusement, but the weather was cold and the streets all so dirty and snowy that it looked very dismal. The Thames was nearly quite frozen over. I have heard nothing of late of our old shipmates. Captain Fitz Roy is head of a department for keeping an account of observations on wind, weather, and currents made over all the world. He is married again, but I have not seen his wife. Captain Sulivan acquired much credit in the Baltic, and he has now commissioned another small ship, and will sail again soon for the Baltic, and I shall go and see him before he sails. He has now six or seven children. Captain Stokes is in England. I saw him some months ago. I hear he does little now but shoot and hunt. There has been terrible dissatisfaction in England about the management of the war, which seems to have been very badly conducted; but the men and officers have behaved most nobly, and have made the name of Englishmen a prouder thing than ever. Let me hear again from you. To what shall you bring up your boys? I wish to God I knew what to do with mine.— Believe me, with every good wish, your friend, | C. DARWIN."

I did not know of or had forgotten the clover case. How I wish I knew what plants the Clover took the place of; but that would require more accurate knowledge of any one piece of ground than I suppose any one has. In the case of trees, being so long-lived, I sh d . think it would be extremely difficult to distinguish between true & new spreading of a species, & a rotation of crop. With respect to your idea of plants travelling west, I was much struck by a remark of yours in the penultimate Linnean Journal on the spreading of plants from America near Behring St s . Do you not consider so many more seeds & plants being taken from Europe to America, than in a reverse direction, would go some way to account for comparative fewness of naturalised American plants here. Though I think one might wildly speculate on European weeds having become well fitted for cultivated land, during thousands of years of culture, whereas cultivated land would be a new home for native American weeds, & they would not consequently be able to beat their European rivals when put in contest with them on cultivated land. Here is a bit of wild theory! But I did not sit down intending to scribble thus; but to beg a favour of you: I gave Hooker a list of species of Silene, on which Gærtner has experimentised in crossing: now I want extremely to be permitted to say that such & such are believed by M r Bentham to be true species, & such & such to be only varieties. Unfortunately & stupidly Gærtner does not append authors’ names to the species.— Thank you heartily for what you say about my Book; but you will be greatly disappointed; it will be grievously too hypothetical. It will very likely be of no other service than collocating some facts; though I myself think I see my way approximately on the origin of species. But, alas, how frequent, how almost universal it is in an author to persuade himself of the truth of his own dogmas. My only hope is that I certainly see very many difficulties of gigantic stature. Believe me | My dear Sir | Yours very sincerely | C. Darwin If you can remember any cases of one introduced species beating out or prevailing over another, I sh d be most thankful to hear it.— I believe the common Corn Poppy has been seen indigenous in Sicily; I sh d . like to know whether you suppose that seedlings of this wild plant, would stand a contest with our own Poppy: I sh d . almost expect that our Poppies were in some degree acclimatised & accustomed to our corn-fields.

DCP-LETT-2510.xml,1859-10-25 ,1859,"Darwin, C. R.","Lyell, Charles","Wells Terrace | Ilkley, Otley | Yorkshire Oct. 25. My dear Lyell The doctrine of Pallas applied to our domestic breeds, we will say to Dogs, is as follows. He believes that man tamed a wolf in one country, the jackall in another, the fox in another & so on with other species. He does not suppose that these wild species were more variable than others. He hypothetically supposes that when long domesticated they lose their tendency to sterility when crossed with the other domesticated species ; & by their crossing when domesticated he believes that all our domestic races have originated. He or his followers further believe that the crossing gives as a tendency to new characters to arise, & this is not a little hypothetical. The whole doctrine is very hypothetical. Yet I certainly believe (but cannot here give reasons) that the American domestic dogs have descended from at least 3 or 4 aboriginally distinct species, & that European dogs probably from several other species. There truly is, as you say, “an uncomfortable vague-ness” in whole doctrine. You will see that I have spoken cautiously on subject. It is a curious, but not important subject for us: we believe that all canine species have descended from one parent; & the only question is whether the whole or only a part of difference between our domestic breeds has arisen since man domesticated them. I do not see how the question concerns specific centres.— The importance of period of gest-ation, has, I think, been much exaggerated: there is great individual difference in the period in our improved cattle, & by selection, a breed could in all probability be easily made with longer or shorter period.— The Races of Man offer great difficulty: I do not think doctrine of Pallas, or that of Agassiz that there are several species of man, helps us in the least.— I fancy I have got some rays of light on subject; but mutiny in India stopped some important enquiries. Much too long a subject for letter. I will add I do not attribute much effect to climate &c.— I believe, as you will see when you reread, that some plants migrated through Tropical lowlands during glacial period. I am terribly lame with inflamed leg (what the Water-cure Doctors call a severe crisis) & this makes my hand-writing rather worse even than usual.— If my book is reviewed in Quarterly, how I hope that Sir. H. Holland will not be Reviewer: he is so presumptuous & knows so little. Our difference on “principle of improvement” & “power of adaptation” is too profound for discussion by letter. If I am wrong, I am quite blind to my error. If I am right, our difference will be got over only by your rereading carefully & reflecting on my first four chapters. I supplicate you to read these again carefully.— The so-called improvement of our short-horn cattle, pigeons &c, does not presuppose or require any aboriginal “power of adaptation” or “principle of improvement”; it requires only diversified variability, & man to select or take advantage of those modifications which are useful to him: so under nature any slight modification which chances to arise & is useful to any creature is selected or preserved in the struggle for life; any modification which is injurious is destroyed or rejected; any which is neither useful nor injurious will be left a fluctuating element.— When you contrast natural selection & “Improvement”, you seem always to overlook (for I do not see how you can deny) that every step in the natural selection of each species implies improvement in that species in relation to its conditions of life. No modification can be selected without it be an improvement or advantage. Improvement implies, I suppose, each form obtaining many parts or organs, all excellently adapted for their functions. As each species is improved, & as the number of forms will have increased if we look to the whole course of time, the organic conditions of life for other forms will become more complex; & there will be a necessity for other forms to become improved or they will be exterminated; and I can see no limit to this process of improvement without the intervention of any other & direct principle of improvement. All this seems to me quite compatable with certain forms, fitted for simple conditions, remaining unaltered, or being degraded. If I have a second Edit. I will reiterate, “Natural Selection, & as a general consequence Natural Improvement”.— As you go as far as you do, I begin strongly to think, judging from myself, that you will go much further. How slowly the older geologists admitted your grand views on existing geological causes of change!— If at any time you think I can answer any question, it is a real pleasure to me to write.— Yours affect y | C. Darwin"

V.","It is a full year since we met—or since any friendly missive has passed between us—and strange to say, I am the party this time to break silence and speak the foremost word. I have been dying like all the world besides to see your book upon species out, and think a slight dose of hanging might be administered to John Murray—with much advantage, for keeping it back so long. I met your brother at the Athenæum, a few days ago—and learnt from him, that the book is fairly out of your hands—and that you were still in Yorkshire. Apropos to species, I have lately been occupied with a case, that ought to have some interest for you. In a newly explored cave in South Wales, we have come upon no fewer than 800 eight hundred antlers of Deer 95 per cent of them shed horns and nearly the same ratio of young animals. The variety in form is so great, that had only one or two of each of the most marked types been met with, they would have been described most probably as distinct species. But when the 800 are spread out, the passage from the one into the other is so easily traced, that there is no making out well marked distinctions between them. Now they all—or at any rate the greater part of them—belong to the Rein-Deer of the Glacial period in England: and some of the horns differ in the most remarkable manner from any form of the modern Rein Deer, that I have been able to get at, either in figures—or in the London Collection. Would it not be nicely to your hand to investigate whether the characters of the species have remained persistent, from the older time down to the present day—or if modified now, what amount of change has taken place during the long lapse of ages, and what direction it has mainly taken? The inquiry would make a pretty pendant to the case of those dreadful pidgeons, upon which you have been practising such tricks of leger-de-main. I am still very weak in the bronchiæ and ought to have gone abroad before now—but I have been hanging on—never having felt so reluctant to leave England, or the neighbourhood of London even, as I have a good deal to do with arrears of late work. You know what a start the question of the relative antiquity of man has made within the last twelvemonth. Lyell has forgotten all his prudence and thrown himself head long into the bosom of two heresies—the transmutation of species, and glacial homo. You are answerable for the one—and I have had a little to do in starting the [ scent ] of the other. With kind regards | Yours very sinc ly | H. Falconer Ch as .

DCP-LETT-2513.xml,1859-10-31 ,1859,"Darwin, C. R.","Shoberl, William","Wells Terrace. Ilkley Otley Y. Monday 31 st My dear Lyell That you may not misunderstand how far I go with Pallas & his many disciples, I sh d . like to add that, though I believe that our domestic Dogs have descended from several wild forms, & though I must think that the sterility which they would probably have evinced if crossed before being domesticated, has been eliminated, yet I go but a very little way with Pallas & Co. in their belief in the importance of the crossing & blending of the aboriginal stocks: you will see this briefly put in first chapter.— Generally with respect to crossing, the effects may be diametrically opposite: if you cross two very distinct races, you may make (not that I believe such has often been made) a third & new intermediate race. But if you cross two exceedingly close races or two slightly different individuals of the same race, then in fact you annul & obliterate the differences.— In this latter way I believe crossing is all-important; & now for 20 years I have been working at flowers & insects under this point of view.— I do not like Hooker’s terms centripetal & centrifugal; they remind me of Forbes’ bad term of Polarity.— I daresay selection by man would generally work quicker than natural selection; but the important distinction between them is that man can scarcely select except external & visible characters, & secondly he selects for his own good; whereas under nature characters of all kinds are selected exclusively for each creature’s own good, & are well exerrcised: but you will find all this in Ch. IV.— Although the Hound—Greyhound & Bull-dog may possibly have descended from 3 distinct stocks, I am convinced that their present great amount of difference is mainly due to the same causes, which have made the breeds of pigeons so different from each other, though these breeds of pigeons have all descended from one wild stock. So that the Pallasian doctrine, I look at, as of but quite secondary importance. In my bigger book I have explained my meaning fully; whether I have in the abstract, I cannot remember.— Yours affect— | C. Darwin"
DCP-LETT-2540A.xml,1859-11-21 ,1859,"Darwin, C. R.","Darwin, Emma","The admission which I least like among your familiar illustrations is that while the various pigeons have descended from one stock the dogs have come from two or more species It seems to me that an occasional cross with some one of the several wolves, the grey & the prairie wolf or even perhaps some foxes & more distant species of the canine genus would have served all the purposes you require. Let these have been more frequent than in the case of most domestic animals, let the hybrid have always interbred with one of the pure parent stock but the infusion of the foreign blood into the domesticated wolf, or whatever single species the dog came from, may have given rise to a tendency to reversion to some of the ancestral crosses why should not they satisfy all your well-ascertained facts, leaving your canons of variation & hybridity unshaken. It is for the followers of Pallas to prove their opinion by some facts. The period of gestation of the dog & the wolf, if as constant as Bell believes, is a strong argument. As Bransby Cooper was a six month’s child, I doubt not you can find great occasional irregularity in the gestation of domestic animals & of Man—but still it is surely worth a good deal.—"

Could I have seen M r Wilkie, I should have obtained what you wanted readily, but he has been and still continues absent in a distant parish. I now send you what may be acceptable until I am able completely to meet your wishes. There are in the box four workers and one drone. M r March, a naturalist very well known to Sir William Hooker ,—from whom I procured these specimens, promises me a complete suite from the Queen downwards.

I observed in Cuba that its place was occupied by the Columba Carolinensis of Wilson, and I am hardly mistaken in saying the same prevalence of the one dove for the other occurs in Haïti. Our ground Lizard Ameiva dorsalis, so brilliant and beautiful with its blue tail grad-uating into green, and sides golden-streaked (v: Gosse’s Nat.

As probably you would like to hear my opinion though a non-Botanist, I will give it without any exaggeration. To my judgment it is by far the grandest & most interesting Essay on subjects of the nature discussed I have ever read. You know how I admired your former essays, but this seems to me far grander. I like all the part after p. xxvi better than the first part; probably because newer to me. I daresay you will demur to this, for I think every author likes the most speculative parts of his own productions. How superior your essay is to the famous one of Brown (here will be sneer first from you).— You have made all your conclusions so admirably clear that it would be no use at all to be a Botanist (sneer no r 2.). By Jove it would do harm to affix any idea to the long names of outlandish orders,—one can look at your conclusions with the philosophic abstraction with which a mathematician looks at his diag here &c &c    I hardly know which parts have interested me most; for over & over again I exclaimed this beats all. The general comparison of Flora of Australia with rest of world strikes me (as before) as extremely original, good & suggestive of many reflexions p. xxxiii Orders next most abundant in species in S. Africa, & yet several of these orders being most abundant in S. E corner seems to weaken your remarks on affinity of S. W corner & S. Africa, but I suppose I cannot weigh affinity of the different orders.— By the way I call that affinity between S.W. corner & S. Africa, a nasty ugly inexplicable fact.— The invading Indian Flora very interesting; but I think the fact you mention towards close of Essay that the Indian vegetation in contradistinction to Malayan vegetation is found on low & level parts of Malay Is d . greatly lessens the difficulty which at first (p. L ) seemed so great. There is nothing like one’s own hobby Horse, I suspect it is same case as of Glacial migration & of naturalised productions of productions of greater area conquering those of lesser: of course the Indian forms would have greater difficulty in seizing on the cool parts of Australia.— I demur to your remarks (p. L ) as not “conceiving anything in soil climate or vegetation of India” which could stop the introduction of Australian plants.— Towards close of Essay (p. civ) you have admirable remarks on our profound ignorance of cause of possible naturalisation or introduction; I would answer p. L. by a later page. viz p. civ.— Your contrast of SW & SE. corners is one of the most wonderful cases I ever heard of (do you not rather too much pass over Eyere’s intermediate deserts?); you show the case with wonderful force. Your discussion on mixed invaders of S.E. corner (& of N. Zealand) is as curious & intricate a problem as of the races of man in Britain. Your remark on mixed invading Flora keeping down or destroying an original Flora which was richer in number of species, strikes me as eminently new & important . I am not sure whether to me the discussion on N. Zealand Flora is not even more instructive. I cannot too much admire both. But it will require long time to suck in all the facts. Your case of the largest Australian orders having none or very few species in N. Zealand is truly marvellous. Anyhow you have now demonstrated (together with no mammals in N. Zealand) (bitter sneer no r . 3.) that N. Zealand has never been continuously or even nearly continuously united by land to Australia!! At p. Lxxxix is only sentence (on this subject) in whole Essay at which I am much inclined to quarrel, viz that no theory of transoceanic migration can explain &c &c.— Now I maintain against all the world that no man knows anything about power of transoceanic power of migration. You do not know whether or not the absent orders have seeds which are killed by sea-water like almost all Leguminosæ & like another order which I forget. Birds do not migrate from Australia to N. Zealand, & therefore flotation seems only possible means; but yet I maintain that we do not know enough to argue on question; especially as we do not know the main fact whether seeds of Australian orders are killed by sea-water. The discussion on European Genera profoundly interesting; but here alone I earnestly beg for more information viz to know which of these genera are absent in Tropics of world, ie confined to Temperate regions.— I excessively wish to know, on the notion of Glacial migration , how much modification has taken place in Australia: I had better explain when we meet, & get you to go over & mark the list.— (N.B with respect to Glacial migration my remark is simple, & in the spirit of Agassiz, it must be true, for Nature does not lie.) What capital lists you give of temperate forms in S. Africa & Fuegia! The list of Naturalised plants extremely interesting; but why at the end in the name of all that is good & bad do you not sum up & comment on your facts? Come, I will have a sneer at you in return for the many which you will have launched at this letter. Should you have remarked on the number of plants naturalised in Australia & U. States under extremely different climates , as showing that climate is so important; & that the considerable sprinkling of plants from India, N. America & S. Africa as showing that the frequent introduction of seed is so important? With respect to “abundance of unoccupied ground in Australia” do you believe that European plants introduced by man now grow on spots in Australia, which were absolutely bare? But I am an impudent dog. One must defend one’s own puny theories, against such cruel men as you. I daresay this letter will appear very conceited, but one must form an opinion on what one reads with attention, & in simple truth I cannot find words strong enough to express my admiration of your Essay. My dear old friend | Yours affec ly | C. Darwin I received half-an-hour ago your note. Sir J. Richardson might have added to his exploded fallacies the Quinarian System, in which he formerly believed. I can quite sympathise in the old not being ever staggered.

Some of the remarks about the lapse of years are very good, & the Reviewer gives me some good & well deserved raps,—confound it I am sorry to confess the truth. But it does not at all concern main argument.— That was a nice notice in G. Chronicle. I hope & imagine that Lindley is almost a convert.— Do not forget to tell me if Bentham gets at all more staggered. With respect to Tropical plants during Glacial period, I throw in your teeth your own fact at base of Himalaya on possibility of the coexistence of at least forms of Tropics & Temperate regions.

Reflect on many cases which could be given, & shall be given in my larger book (independently of hybridity) of very slight changes of conditions causing one species to be quite sterile & not affecting a closely allied species.— How profoundly ignorant we are on this intimate relation between conditions of life & impaired fertility in pure species.— The only point which I might add to my short discussion on this subject, is that I think it probable that the want of adaptation to uniform conditions of life in our domestic varieties has played an important part in preventing their acquiring sterility when crossed. For this want of uniformity & changes in the conditions of life seems only cause of the elimination of sterility (When crossed) under domestication. This elimination though admitted by many authors rests on very slight evidence, yet I think is very probably true,—as may be inferred from the case of dogs.— Under nature it seems improbable that the differences in the reproductive constitution, on which the sterility of any two species when crossed depends, can be acquired directly by natural selection; for it is of no advantage to the species. Such differences in reproductive constitution must stand in correlation with some other differences; but how impossible to conjecture what these are! Reflect on case of the vars. of Verbascum which differ in no other respects whatever besides the fluctuating element of colour of flower, & yet it is impossible to resist Gärtner’s evidence, that this difference in the colour does affect the mutual fertility of the varieties. The whole case seems to me far too mysterious to rest valid attack on the theory of modification of species, though, as you say, it offers excellent ground for mere advocate.— I am surprised considering how ignorant we are on very many points, that more weak parts in my Book have not as yet been pointed out to me. No doubt many will be. H. C. Watson founds objection in M.S. on there being no limit to infinite diversification of species: I have answered this I think satisfactorily, & have sent attack & answer to Lyell & Hooker. If this seems to you good objection, I would send papers to you.— Andrew Murray “disposes of” the whole theory by ingenious difficulty from distribution of blind cave insects; but it can, I think, be fairly answered.

DCP-LETT-2650.xml,1860-01-14 ,1860,"Darwin, C. R.","Nitsche, Hinrich","Your gossip about Reviewer has interested & amused me much.— I have reread Gardeners Ch. with extreme pleasure now that I know Hooker is author.— Jeffreys’ letter is really not worth sending: he says nothing about migration but only refers me to his paper on Testacea of Piedmont in Annals & Mag. of Nat. History for Feb. 1856. He refers, to another paper on British shells, but gives no sort of reference , & I have looked over all his papers, which I have, & can find nothing. Perhaps I spoke too strongly about his non-migration views;; I remember thinking him far too narrow & decided in his opposition to Forbes. for casting my eye now over his paper I find my memory seems to have exaggerated his non-migration doctrine. I hardly understand what he objects to, in my Book; unless it be that I follow Forbes on Glacial migration— I am convinced from littoral shells of Galapagos Arch. that such shells must have some great power of migration; for if you require continuous coasts for the migration of littoral shells, you would have to unite these islands, within the period of living shells both to America & the far distant Pacific islands, which, I presume would stagger even the warmest followers of Forbes. By the way it strikes me that one of grandest points in Hooker’s Essay is the (in my eyes, but I presume by no means in his eyes) demonstration that N. Zealand has not been continuously, or even nearly continuously, united with Australia within recent times. I shall be much interested in reading your man discussion, & will give my opinion carefully whatever that may be worth; but I have so long looked at you as the type of cautious scientific judgment (to my mind one of the highest & most useful qualities) that I suspect my opinion will be superfluous.—   It makes me laugh to think what a joke it will be, if I have to caution you, after your cautions on same subject to me!.— I will order Owen’s Book: I am very glad to hear Huxley’s opinion on his classification of man; without having due knowledge it seemed to me from very first absurd. All classifications founded on single character, I believe have failed. I agree with Huxley that it is a difficulty about no ascertained varieties known to have been raised by man, being sterile together: varieties of same kind, I believe, not rarely prefer pairing together; I have fact on this head. But I think Huxley had not considered my discussion. (p. 268 new Edit.) The sterility of the vars of Verbascum is a most wonderful case, & that of Tobaccos. But the subject of sterility is so profoundly mysterious, as I could show, & as anyone will see who will read even my short chapter, that it would be truly wonderful if no difficulties were presented; & as you say the subject would be no subject for discussion. With respect to Geoffroy St. Hilaire, I have been glancing over his Life by Isidore & his Principes; & it seems to me that he was a rather doubtful maintainer of change of species.— Isidore writes to me that he himself is a firm maintainer of such views: he says he has sent me a publication of his to show this, but it has not arrived. With respect to cave insects the same seeing genera do range over, as you well know, Europe & N. America, & the difficulty applies chiefly in this case of America & Europe. Do you know of any miocene or pliocene fossil insect in N. America ; your hint would be very valuable , if I could show that some extinct genera were common to both countries?— Goodnight— | Yours affect | C. Darwin What a grand, immense benefit you conferred on me by getting Murray to publish my Book.— I never till to day realised that it was getting widely distributed; for in a letter from a lady today to Emma, she says she heard a man enquiring for it at Railway Station !!! at Waterloo Bridge; & the Bookseller said that he had none till new Edit. was out.— The Bookseller said he had not read it but had heard it was a very remarkable book!!!

It is not easy to understand how, with a similar capability of modification in all, some cells should remain in their originally simple condition whilst others should, within the same period, have become modified by mere natural selection into the most highly organized & complicated structures. Something might be said, it seems to me, in favour of a general degradation or degeneration taking place under certain conditions, just as a single organ, complicated in structure in some species, is found rudimentary only in allied ones. You would be extremely interested to see how the Lantana aculeata , an introduction from the Mauritius about 35–40 years ago, is spreading all over the uncultivated parts of the country which are not under forest—   Some of the indigenous plants would indeed have a hard struggle for existence if it were not for the interposition of man’s labour.

Bravard’s discoveries seem to me magnificent, & especially interesting is the fact of Palæotherium Paranense, taken with (I think) the Nebraska Palæotherium. Bravard has sent me two Spanish pamphlets (which I find to my surprise I can hardly translate) in which he has strange geological doctrine, of whole enormous Pampean deposit being a subaerial deposit.— He disputes the coembedment of the Bahia Blanca fossils with recent shells; but I am by no means convinced. It seems to me impossible that a whole skeleton, (even to knee-cap) could be washed out of one formation & embedded in another & that other formation a turbulent one with largish pebbles & cross layers.— I am perfectly convinced (having read this morning) that the Review in Annals is by Wollaston: no one else in the world would have used so many parentheses. I have written to him & told him that the “pestilent” fellow thanks him for his kind manner of speaking about him. I have also told him that he w d . be pleased to hear that the B. of Oxford says it is the most unphilosophical work he has ever read.— The review seems to me clever & only misinterprets me in a few places. Like all hostile men he passes over the explanation given of Classification, Morphology, Embryology & Rudimentary organs &c.— — I read Wallace’s paper in M.S & thought it admirably good: he does not know that he has been anticipated about depth of intervening sea determining distribution. The expression “coincidence” in time & space between new & old species is unfortunate, as he believes, as we do, that new species are very slowly formed.— The most curious point in Paper seems to me that about the African character of the Celebes productions; but I sh d . require further confirmation: I believe the aberrant Anoa, or so-called Antelope is really a small Buffalo.— That is a very very interesting fact of the Loess Man belonging to peculiar of man; do get that well worked out.— Remember what you told me of fossil monkey; very man-like in middle Tertiaries. I will send (when I get from Hooker) Asa Gray’s capital review.— Henslow is staying here: I have had some talk with him: he is in much same state as Bunbury & will go a very little way with us, but brings up no real argument against going further. He, also, shudders at the Eye! It is really curious (& perhaps is an argument in our favour) how differently different opposers view the subject.— Henslow used to rest his opposition on imperfection of Geolog: Record, but he now thinks nothing of this, & says I have got well out of it; I wish I could quite agree with him. Baden Powell says he never read anything so conclusive as my statement about the Eye!! A stranger writes to me about “sexual selection” & regrets that I boggle about such a trifle as the brush of Hair on Male Turkey. And so on.— As L. Jenyns has a really philosophical mind, & as you say you like to see everything, I send an old letter of his. In a later letter to Henslow which I have seen, he is more candid than any opposer I have heard of; for he says though he cannot go as far as I do, yet he can give no good reason why he should not.— It is funny how each man draws his own imaginary line at which to halt.— It reminds me so vividly what I was told about you, when I first commenced geology, to believe a little but on no account to believe all.— Ever yours affect | C. Darwin I hope you will succeed in finding out what the great Celts were used for, it bears on state of civilisation of the old natives.— Henslow means this spring to visit the Celt-Beds in France Many thanks for Bunbury letter received this morning & for your note.— I doubt whether I use term Natural Selection more as a Person, than writers use Attraction of Gravity as governing the movement of Planets &c. but I suppose I could have avoided the ambiguity.

As it has chanced I have used in letters this very same argument, little knowing that anyone had really thus objected to Law of Gravity.—   Newton answers by saying that it is philosophy to make out the movements of a clock, though you do not know why the weight descends to ground.—   Leibnitz further objected that the Law of Gravity was opposed to natural Religion!— Is this not curious?

Edit. & how kind it is in you to go on troubling yourself on the subject.— It seems very true that as you have put your hand in it, it is not so easy to draw it out. What a battle you do seem to have been fighting on the origin of species.—   I can most plainly see that whatever amount of truth my book may contain, the saving of it (as I told Hooker the other day) will surely be wholly due to a very small body of men. Had it not been for Lyell, Hooker, yourself & two or three others, I am well convinced my book & the whole subject would have been mere flash in the pan. For the attacks are now here incessant & very bitter. For instance Sedgwick & Prof. Clarke attacked me savagely at Cambridge Phil. Soc. but dear old Henslow (though he goes but little way with me) stood up manfully for the subject as legitimately within bounds of science, & produced excellent effect.— Since then Prof. Phillips the Geologist has lectured against me at Cambridge— A. Murray the Entomologist has read paper at Royal Soc. of Edinburgh against me. D r Dawson in Canada Nat. Mag. do. Some one in Dublin Nat. Mag. M r Haughton at Dublin Geolog. Soc. And thus I could go on for many more!! But the effect on me is that I will buckle on my armour & fight my best. You seem to have done so allready in grand style. And I believe Hooker will, as certainly will Lyell & Huxley. But it will be a long fight. By myself I sh d . be powerless. I feel my weak health acutely, as I cannot work hard.—   So bitter is the feeling of some that Hooker tells me that neither Harvey, Balfour, or Arnott have ever read his Australian Essay! Is this not incredibly paltry? It makes me savage to think of the slighting way in which Owen alludes to Hooker’s Essay in Edinburgh Review. Lyell is working very hard at geological history of Man; & it is really marvellous how rapidly curious facts are turning up. I expect his Essay, in which he will discuss origin of species, will make a great commotion with the reading public. Thanks about red “ roots ”.— I most sincerely hope that you may publish your stunner of an answer to Bowen Agassiz & Co.— With hearty thanks | Yours most sincerely | C. Darwin"

DCP-LETT-2820.xml,1860-06-01 ,1860,"Darwin, C. R.","Lyell, Charles","Poor Etty’s fever drags on its weary course & Sunday will be five weeks.— I believe there is no cause yet for serious anxiety, but we have sent for Sir H. Holland to aid our local Doctor.— I sent yesterday A. Murray’s review: the speculative parts seem to me weak. I am not convinced that I have misrepresented Schiödte.— Have you seen Hopkins in the new Fraser? the public will I sh d think, find it heavy. He will be dead against me as you prophesied; but he is generously civil to me personally. On his standard of proof, natural science would never progress; for without the making of theories, I am convinced there would be no observation. I have ordered the Future, & have begun reading the N. British, which so far strikes me as clever. Phillips’ Lecture at Cambridge is to be published. All these reiterated attacks will tell heavily; there will be no more converts & probably some will go back. I hope you do not grow disheartened. I am determined to fight to the last.—   I hear, however, that the great Buckle highly approves of my Book.— I have had note from poor Blyth of Calcutta, who is much disappointed at hearing that L. Canning will not grant any money; so I much fear that all your great pains will be thrown away. Blyth says (& he in many respect a very good judge) that his ideas on Species are quite revolutionised. I send Asa Gray’s letter, though it is really not worth sending; & do not return it till you have occasion to write; though if I were not the most honourable of men, I should jump at the excuse of getting a note from you & require his letter back soon.— I have never attended to gestation of dog question, thinking it’s importance overrated, as the period is known to be variable in many of our domestic animals.— But I have begun to make some enquiries, & have got accurate return from excellent stud of Grey-hounds—period varies from 60— or 61 (according as 1 st day reckoned)—to 65 or 66 days. I do not think lowness of Rodents has any bearing on the question of fertility of Hybrids, as plants, & even Fuci, follow same general laws in these respects with animals.— My dear Lyell | Ever yours | C. Darwin"
DCP-LETT-2822.xml,1860-06-06 ,1860,"Darwin, C. R.","Lyell, Charles","We think Etty is rather better today; her pulse has fallen & she seems stronger. We had Sir H. Holland down on Sunday, & though he thought there was no immediate cause for anxiety, he discouraged us in hopes of speedy recovery. Did you read Haughton in Dublin Mag. of Nat. Hist. He is more coarsely contemptuous than even M r Dunns in N. British & overdoes everyone else in misrepresentation. I never knew anything so unfair as his ignoring in his remarks on Bee’s cells the almost exactly intermediate comb of Melipona; & so in many other cases. It consoles me that he sneers at Malthus, for that clearly shows, mathematician though he may be, he cannot understand common reasoning. By the way what a discouraging example Malthus is to show during what long years the plainest case may be misrepresented & misunderstood. I have read the “Future”: how curious it is that several of my reviewers sh d advance such wild arguments as that vars. of dogs & cats do not mingle; & sh d . bring up the old exploded doctrine of definite analogies or Quinarianism.— I am beginning to despair of ever making the majority understand my notions. Even Hopkins does not thoroughly. (by the way I have been so much pleased by the way he personally alludes to me) I must be a very bad explainer. I hope to Heaven that you will succeed better. Several Reviews, & several letters have shown me too clearly how little I am understood. I suppose “natural selection” was bad term; but to change it now, I think, would make confusion worse confounded. Nor can I think of better; “Natural preservation” would not imply a preservation of particular varieties & would seem a truism; & would not bring man’s & nature’s selection under one point of view. I can only hope by reiterated explanations finally to make matter clearer. If my M.S. spreads out, I think I shall publish one volume exclusively on “Variation of animals & plants under domestication”. I want to show that I have not been quite so rash as many suppose.— Though weary of Reviews, I sh d . like to see Lowell sometime, & likewise ( if you can spare ) Binney on Coal & Schaafhausen or some such name on natural selection.— I suppose Lowell’s difficulty about instinct is same as Bowens; but it seems to me wholly to rest on assumption that instincts cannot graduate as finely as structure. I have stated in my volume, that it is hardly possible to know which i.e. whether instinct or structure changes first by insensible steps.— Probably sometimes instinct, sometimes structure.— When a British insect feeds on exotic plant, instinct has changed. by very small step & then structure might change so as to fully profit by new food. Or structure might change first, as the direction of tusks in one var. of Indian Elephant, which leads it to attack the tiger in different manner from other kinds of Elephants.— Thanks for your letter of 2 d , chiefly about Murray (N.B Harvey of Dublin gives me in letter the argument of tall men marrying short women, as one of great weight!) I attributed in Origin blindness of cave animals not, (as you say) to “selection of million of chance varieties” but exclusively to disuse. But about insects I was hasty, I knew (but overlooked bearing of fact) that one genus Adelops is found under moss out of caves & yet blind. It is possible that the genus Anophthalmus (a Carabidous Beetle) was similarly an extra-cavernal blind insect. It seems not unlikely that a blind insect would be less inconvenienced in dark cave than other insects & would become tenant. There were several passages in Murray’s article which I could not clearly understand. I do not quite understand what you mean by saying “that the more they prove that you underrate physical conditions, the better for you, as geology comes into your aid.”— Godron puts well the little effect of climate , which always becomes stronger & stronger conviction on my mind. I do not say confidently food.—   I see in Murray & many others, one incessant fallacy when alluding to slight differences of physical conditions as being very important; namely oblivion of fact that all species, except very local ones, range over a considerable area, & though exposed to what they would call considerable diversities, yet keep constant. I have just alluded to this in Origin in comparing productions of Old & New Worlds. Farewell. Shall you be at Oxford? If Etty gets quite well; perhaps I shall go there.—   Yours affect | C. Darwin"

Such brief books as I have, say structure of Gymnadenia like Orchis, but I find the stigma consists of two most curious lateral horns; I must think these horns are the stigma, from what follows— push thick needle down mouth of nectary & the two pollen masses adhere by thin long naked strap-shaped sticky glands, & then when needle withdrawn by elasticity become nearly parallel to needle. In doing this not a grain of pollen is left on the horn-like stigma— But here comes pretty fact, hold needle in same relative position to parts of flower & push into nectary of another flower, & lots of grains of pollen are almost inevitably left on the two humid stigmas. In fact G. conopsea would hardly ever get a grain of pollen of its own flower! I was led to observe this by finding that the 13 pollen-masses on the proboscis of Acontia luctuosa belonged to this orchis.— I see Bentham puts this plant into genus Orchis, but surely such a difference in stigma, & naked & curious strap-formed glands must be good generic character. If, as is likely, you do not care or are too busy to look at this, as it seems to me really beautiful relation of part, ask M r Bentham, whether he will.— I see the stigmatic horns rise from spot where stigma lies in true Orchis.

The first thought which occurred to me was endosmose (& I tried olive oil & wine).— I have tried so many experiments that I cannot think I am in error. I rely much in the case of the saliva experiments on the diminishing effect of weaker & weaker doses. Sulphate & Muriate of Ammonia, Nitrate of Potash & N. of Lime produce none or hardly any effect. With respect to the Vegetable fluids I rely on nitrogenous fluid placed on the same leaves subsequently causing contraction, whereas the vegetable matters produced no effect.— Nothing ought to be placed under the leaf as a support, for I have ascertained (in our Drosera) that irritation on the smooth under side of leaf causes contraction. So small a drop ought to be put on as not to entangle the marginal hairs, as the act of drying of a viscid fluid mechanically draws the hairs together.— Are you sure that there is no glue with your gum? I tried pure white gum & it produced no action at all. Nor did syrup of white sugar or starch.— For Heaven sake try some pure gum.— You have given me a panic. I tried milk on 9 leaves thin Gelatine on 4 White of egg on 6 Saliva on 8 Urine on 11 Mucus on 4 infusion of meat 1 — 43 leaves.— and all strongly contracted on different plants I have not tried vegetable fluid so largely only 3 or 4 leaves for each; for absolutely no effect was produced.

Most cryptogamic plants certainly contain nitrogen.— For Heaven sake dissolve fresh pure , white gum & try again.

V.","My dear Henslow Just before coming here for our poor girl’s health (I am glad to say that she has benefitted decidedly from sea-air) I received your little note, telling me that you were not quite satisfied on antiquity of the Celts. I fear that this truly dreadful weather will give me no chance of my weed-seeds.— My object in writing now is to beg for a bit of information; & I cannot think of any one else to apply to, otherwise I would not have troubled you.— I have been making a great number of observations on the leaves of Drosera, & have come to some curious results about their power of discriminating nitrogenised compounds.— When the viscid hairs contract or become inflected; they pour out much fluid & the contents of the cells in the footstalks, instead of being a thin pink homogeneous fluid, becomes a broken mass of dark red, thick fluid. When the cells are in this condition, the particles circulate round the cell, as if driven by ciliæ. I believe that this is not an uncommon circumstance: is it? But what has surprised me is that the globules & cylinders of the thick dark red fluid or substance keeps on an incessant slow contracting & expanding movement: they often coalesce & then separate again; they often send out buds, which rapidly increase at the expence of the larger parent mass; in short endless slow changes in form. These slow incessant movements, which are quite independent of the circulation, resemble the movements of sarcode in the protozoa. Is any such phenomenon known? it may be quite common, as I am so ignorant of vegetable physiology.—   It has surprised me much. Will you be so very kind, whenever you have a little leisure, to let me hear— I hope you have returned well & strong after your tour. What a wonderful start this of Hooker’s.!— My dear Henslow | Yours affectionately | C. Darwin P.S. Though I cannot conceive how it can be effected, I presume that the movement in the red matter must be due to slow absorption of water. Yet how this should make the globules coalesce, divide, coalesce again & bud out into new globules, it is hard to understand.—"

He does not know that eye of Tucutucu was carefully dissected.— With respect to Reviews by A. Gray: I thought of sending the Dialogue to Saturday Review in a week’s time or so, as they have lately discussed design.— I have sent the 2 d or August Atlantic article to Annals & Mag. of N. History. The copy which you have I want to send to Pictet, as I told A. Gray I would, thinking from what he said he would like this to be done.— I doubt whether it will be possible to get October number reprinted in this country; so that I am in no hurry at all for this.— I had a letter a few weeks ago from Symonds on imperfection of G. Record, less clear & forcible than I expected. I answered him at length & very civilly, though I could hardly make out what he was driving at. He spoke about you in a way which it did me good to read.— I am extremely glad that you like A. Gray’s Reviews. How generous & unselfish he had been in all his labours. Are you not struck by his metaphors & similes?—   I have told him he is a poet & not a lawyer.— I should altogether doubt on turtles being converted into land tortoises on any one island: remember how closely similar tortoises are on all continents, as well as islands; they must have all descended from one ancient progenitor; including the gigantic tortoise of Himalaya.— I think you must be cautious in not running to convenient doctrine that only one species out of very many ever varies.— Reflect on such cases as the fauna & Flora of Europe. N. America & Japan, which are so similar & yet which have a great majority of their species, either specifically distinct or forming well marked races. We must in such cases incline to belief that a multitude of species were once identically the same in all 3 countries when under warmer climate more in connection; & have varied in all three countries. I am inclined to believe that almost every species (as we see with nearly all our domestic productions) varies sufficiently for natural selection to pick out & accumulate new specific differences, under new organic & inorganic conditions of life; whenever a place is open in the polity of nature. But that looking to a long lapse of time & to the whole world or to large parts of the world, I believe only one or a few species of each large genus ultimately becomes victorious & leaves modified descendants. To give imaginary instance, the Jay has become modified in the 3 countries into (I believe) 3 or 4 species; but the Jay genus is not, apparently, so dominant a group as the crows, & in the long run probably all the Jays will be exterminated & be replaced perhaps by some modified crows.— I merely give this illustration to show what seems to me probable. But oh what work there is before we shall understand the genealogy of organic beings.— With respect to Apteryx: I know not enough of anatomy, but ask D r . F. whether clavicle &c do not give attachment to some of muscles of respiration. If my views are at all correct; wing of Apteryx cannot be (p. 452 of Origin) a nascent organ, as these wings are useless. I dare not trust to memory, but I know I found whole sternum always reduced in size in all the fancy & confined pigeons, relatively to the same bones in the wild rock-pigeon: the keel was generally still further reduced relatively to the reduced length of sternum; but in some breeds it was in a most anomalous manner more prominent.—   I have got a lot of facts on reduction of organs of flight in pigeons, which took me weeks to work out, & which Huxley thought curious.— Yours are interesting remarks on Ammonites—Cuttle-fish & Hippurites. I can hardly make up my mind to keep the Rabbits; but I will think about it. Isidore G. St. Hilaire evidently knows the case only second-hand.— Do not trust Sclangenweit (the Indian Brothers or some such name) about Yaks, if you come across their statement. Isidore, I have a very good opinion of.— Owen rather sneers at him; & I daresay he is not be trusted on Homologies.— I have no doubt there are many reputed species (laying on one side question of fertility) not so distinct as Negro & white man.— Ass & Pony? many foxes. &c.— I am utterly ashamed & groan over my hand-writing. It was “Natural Preservation”. Natural persecution is what the author ought to suffer. It rejoices me that you do not object to the term. Hooker made same remark that it ought to have been “Variation & nat. selection”. Yet with domestic productions, when Selection is spoken of, variation is always implied.—   But I entirely agree with your & Hooker’s remark.— Ever yours affect | C. Darwin Have you begun regularly to write your Book on Antiquity of Man?— I do not agree with your remark that I make N. Selection do too much work.— You will perhaps reply, that every man rides his Hobby-horse to death; & that I am in this galloping state."

If you had had leisure or inclination to have made any general criticisms on the “Origin of Species”; they would have been very far from “superfluous”; for I know hardly anyone whose opinions I should be more inclined to defer to.— I will trouble you with a few remarks on some parts of your letter. Few facts have interested me more than your case of the black Hogs; it shows such a marvellous relation of mere colour, (generally thought to be so unimportant) & constitution: I have long suspected that such correlation of colour & tendency to fevers, might possibly explain the origin of colour of negros; but I can get no facts to support this crude speculation. I have been the more glad to get your Hog case, as I was hardly able to credit the parallel case of sheep in Sicily. With respect to the Cave Rat; I knew that it was a strictly American form; but I did not at all know that the genus had large eyes.—   I know how busy you are, & that you do not much like writing letters; but if you could get me a little information about this Rat, it would be a great kindness.— Firstly, are the eyes of the Cave species not at all larger than in the other species? Secondly, may I trust Prof. Silliman, that the Rat was blind & when kept out of cave, it seemed to acquire some power of vision? And lastly does it inhabit the profoundest depths of caves, or less profound parts?— As I am asking questions, I will ask one other; viz were you struck with any peculiarity in length of hind (?) legs (I am writing away from home, & cannot consult my notes) of the Nãta Cattle? I procured a skull; but it has never been described: would it not be worth your while to insert in some Journal a short description together with the parallel case of the Cod Fish? If you do will you inform me.— From various sources of information I cannot doubt that the breed is rather ancient, & extremely true: I have copious notes on subject, which I hope some day to use.— Speaking of inheritance, I was long inclined to entirely disbelieve with you, that Mutilations are ever inherited; (& I got special enquiries made about the Jews); but I have of late been rather staggered; & now Brown-Sequard’s case of inherited epilepsy from mutilation seems to almost settle question. I have suspected from some facts that mutilations are inherited only when they produced disease. A clever young Surgeon carefully dissected the eyes of the Tucutucu, which I brought home in Spirits, & assured me that there were traces of inflammation. My Spanish informant had no motive, (for I asked no question) to tell me falsely how often they were blind. Does not the case of Cats with blue eyes being deaf (when one blue eye deaf on one side alone of head) strike you as a very odd case: I have lately observed that all kittens have blue eyes when they first open them; & before they open them, they seem to me after several trials, absolutely deaf;—so that I fancy there is at first some correlation between the blue eyes & deafness, & that the blueness is carried on in the old cats, by a sort of correlation or arrest of development the deafness continues; but my ideas are vague enough.— With respect to spinal stripe of Horse; I think it is much too common (& characteristic of every species of the genus) to be explained as your American informant supposes: the stripe seems to be commonest with with colts than with old Horses; in same manner as the foals of the E. Hemionus are well striped when first born.— I have been very glad to hear your remarks on the Brain of Chimpanzee; as will Sir C. Lyell be.— D r . Falconer tells me that Huxley gave Owen the most severe setting down at Oxford on this subject, that ever man received.— I fear the general opinion is true, that Owen truckles to the approbation of those high in church & state. I declare I believe, from some conversation with him that at the bottom of his heart he goes a long way with me on the origin of species, though he has attacked me so severely & not very ingenuously in the Edinburgh Review.— No one other person understands me so thoroughly as Asa Gray. If ever I doubt what I mean myself, I think I shall ask him! His generosity in getting my views a fair hearing, & not caring himself for unpopularity has been most unselfish,—I would say noble. Forgive me for writing at such length & believe me Dear Sir, with cordial thanks & sincere respect. | Yours very faithfully | C. Darwin"

I feel not a shade of surprise at your entirely rejecting my views; my surprise is that I have been successful in converting some few eminent Botanists, Zoologists, & Geologists. In several cases the conversion has been very slow & that is the only sort of conversion which I respect.— I entirely agree with you that there is no more direct proof of variation being un limited in amount than there is that it is strictly limited.— In a new & corrected Edit. of the Origin, which will appear in about a week or two, I have pointed this as emphatically as I could.— I did not formerly explicitly say this (but indirectly in several places) because I thought it was obvious. The manner in which I wish to approach the whole subject, & in which it seems to me it may fairly be approached, I can best illustrate by the case of Light.— The Ether is hypothetical, as are its undulations; but as the undulatory hypothesis groups together & explains a multitude of phenomena, it is universally now admitted as the true theory. The undulations in the ether are considered in some degree probable, because sound is produced by undulations in air. So natural selection, I look at as in some degree probable, or possible, because we know what artificial selection can do.— But I believe in Nat. Selection, not because, I can prove in any single case that it has changed one species into another, but because it groups & explains well (as it seems to me) a host of facts in classification, embryology, morphology, rudimentary organs, geological succession & Distribution.— I have no space to discuss the many points alluded to in your letter.— I cannot see such perfection in structure as you do. In the new Edit. I have attempted to explain how it is that many low forms have not progressed to a higher grade of organisation. I did not allude to the very curious subject of “alternate generations”, because I did not, & do not yet, see, how it has any special bearing on my views.— I look at alternate generations, as not essentially differing from various stages in any one individual larva—a form of gemmation being merely added at some stage. Under this point of view I see no essential difference between alternative generation & metamorphosis: you, I presume, take some very different view.— I forget what Agassiz says on subject.— I quite agree with you that Agassiz’s Review is not in the least unfair. He misunderstands me a good deal.— His “categories of thought”, “ prophetic types” & his views on classification are to me merely empty sounds.

B.",I hope you will not consider that I as a stranger to you am taking too great a liberty in sending you a copy of circular relating to the 〈Tes〉timonial that is being raised for M r Newman. I think naturalists are under a great debt of gratitude to him for organizing the collection of a vast amount of information & valuable facts connected with Natural-History. indeed he stands quite alone as the Naturalists Calenderer & although I have no particular sympathy with Testimonials in general I think M r Newman’s peculiar services demand some marked expression of favor from his brother naturalists— I think I know your “Origin of Species” almost by heart   to me it is a most perplexing question on the one hand the history of man upon the Earth appe〈ars to〉 be a wonderful epitomy of what 〈 two words 〉 has gone before us.— Race struggling with race— Some getting the mastery— The stronger extinguishing the weaker then culminating & perhaps becoming unwieldly by their size & trying to include too great a diversity of components breaking up into different nations—isolated from each other by some peculiar character〈s〉 which though of advantage to them separately were incompatible in association— Each of the young nations at first fill different spheres increase & multiply— all have not the same strength   the more powerful outrun the others   The weakest are wholly extinguished & those of middle power too strong to die & too weak to multiply go dwindling on from age to age as feeble communities bringing down to posterity antiquated characters which have been quite lost in the subdivision of the more vigorous races into modern nations. Then on the other hand the classification of mineral Elements seems to be a close repetition of that in organic nature— Group subordinate to group & unequal amounts of difference between different groups & the individuals of different groups. this cannot be the result of any active process. The grouping together of the Alkalis with very small amounts of difference is most striking not only by arbitrary measures of resemblance but by a most complete series of correlated affinities. Then again as opposed to this close resemblance there are isolated individuals as Carbon Nitrogen Silex &c. & isolated groups of closely related individuals as the Iodine group or the platina group amongst the metals— also sociable groups as the alkalis alkaline Earths. & True Earths. indeed just that kind of variety in the measure of affinity between individuals or groups that we find in the organic kingdoms. then again these are curious colateral relationships (as between the Heavy & light metals thro the resemblance of Lead to Baryta) which look most singularly like geneological affinity.

DCP-LETT-3162.xml,1861-05-17 ,1861,"Darwin, C. R.","Darwin, Francis","Much obliged am I to Mr. Beaton for his very interesting answer to my question. When Mr. Beaton says he does “not know of an instance of the natural crossing of varieties,” I presume he intends to confine his remark to the plants of the flower garden; for every one knows how largely the varieties of the Cabbage cross, as is likewise the case (as I know from careful trial) with Radishes and Onions. It was this fact which led me to suppose that varieties of flower-garden plants would naturally cross. I can quite understand, after reading Mr. Beaton’s remarks, that it would be very difficult, perhaps impossible, to detect such natural crossing from the degree to which most of these varieties vary. I should, however, think that those who raise for sale seeds of distinct varieties of the Hollyhock, Stocks, &c., must know whether it is indispensable to keep the parent plants apart. I will not trouble Mr. Beaton again if he will have the kindness to procure for me answers on one or two points quoted in his paper (June 26, 1860) from the “king of British cross-breeders”—namely, whether I understand rightly that the white Anemone apennina seeding in a mass with the blue ( Anemone apennina? ) produced many pale shades? For this seems to be a case of two varieties naturally crossing, though I want to know the fact for another reason—namely, because Anemone does not secrete nectar; and secondly, whether Mathiola incana and glabra , which the writer speaks of as “crossing freely,” were artificially crossed. Mr. Beaton’s statement (July 24, 1860) that if the pollen of five kinds of Geranium (I presume what botanists call varieties, and not what are called species, are here referred to) are placed on the stigma of a flower, one kind alone takes the lead and produces an effect, seems to me a most curious observation. It is, I fear, unreasonable to ask for a few precise cases on this head; for, as I gather from Mr. Beaton, it must be difficult to know whether one or more kinds have produced an effect, owing to the great variability of crossed varieties. I have been delighted to observe how strongly Mr. Beaton insists that “not a flower in a thousand is fertilised by its own immediate pollen.” This is a subject which I have attended to for the last twenty years. From my experiments on a small scale I would not venture to put the case nearly as strongly as Mr. Beaton does; but on the other hand, some of the plants which Mr. Beaton advances as self-fertilisers seem, as far as I can trust my own observations, doubtful. I will give one instance, as it might possibly induce some one to try the experiment. Leschenaultia formosa has apparently the most effectual contrivance to prevent the stigma of one flower ever receiving a grain of pollen from another flower; for the pollen is shed in the early bud, and is there shut up round the stigma within a cup or indusium. But some observation led me to suspect that nevertheless insect agency here comes into play; for I found by holding a camel-hair pencil parallel to the pistil, and moving it as if it were a bee going to suck the nectar, the straggling hairs of the brush opened the lip of the indusium, entered it, stirred up the pollen, and brought out some grains. I did this to five flowers and marked them. These five flowers all set pods; whereas only two other pods set on the whole plant, though covered with innumerable flowers. The seeds in these pods were bad, or else I had not skill to make them germinate. I became so strongly convinced that insects would be found concerned in the fertilisation of these flowers, that I wrote to Mr. James Drummond, at Swan River in Australia, and asked him to watch the flowers of plants of this order; and he soon wrote to me that he had seen a bee cleverly opening the indusium and extracting pollen; and a bee with its mandibles thus covered with pollen would very likely effect a cross between one individual and another of the same species. I have been told that this pretty plant, the Leschenaultia formosa , never sets seed in this country. I wish some skilful cultivator would rout up the pollen within the indusium in the manner described, and see whether he could not thus get seeds.— Charles Darwin, Down, Bromley, Kent."

It seems to me very good & sound; though I am certainly not an impartial judge. You will have done good service in calling the attention of scientific men to the means & laws of philosophising.— As far as I could judge by the papers your opponents were unworthy of you. How miserably Prof Williamson talked of my reputation, as if that had anything to do with it. As for D r . Lankester he is a mean prater who never observed a new fact, I believe, in his life.— It made me laugh to read of his advice or rather regret that I had not published facts alone. How profoundly ignorant he must be of the very soul of observation. About 30 years ago there was much talk that Geologists ought only to observe & not theorise; & I well remember some one saying, that at this rate a man might as well go into a gravel-pit & count the pebbles & describe their colours. How odd it is that every one should not see that all observation must be for or against some view, if it is to be of any service.— I have returned only lately from a two months’ visit to Torquay, which did my health at the time good; but I am one of those miserable creatures who are never comfortable for 24 hours; & it is clear to me that I ought to be exterminated. I have been rather idle of late; or speaking more strictly working at some miscellaneous papers, which however have some direct bearing on the subject of species; yet I feel guilty at having neglected my larger Book. But to me, observing is much better sport than writing.— I fear that I shall have wearied you with this long note. Pray believe that I feel sincerely grateful that you have taken up the cudgels in defence of the line of argument in the Origin: you will have benefitted the subject.— Many are so fearful of speaking out.— A German naturalist came here the other day & he tells me that there are many in Germany on our side; but that all seem fearful of speaking out & waiting for some one to speak & then many will follow. The naturalists seem as timid, as young ladies should be, about their scientific reputation.— There is much discussion on the subject on the continent even in quiet Holland; & I had a pamphlet from Moscow the other day by a man who sticks up famously on the imperfection of the Geological Record; but complains that I have sadly under rated the variability of the old fossilised animals! But I must not run on; with sincere thanks & respect | Pray believe me | Yours very sincerely | Charles Darwin M r Davidson, who knows some groups of fossils better than any man in Europe, I can see, is coming round by inches, & declares he will well consider & discuss & publish on the relations of the Brachiopods from the earliest dawn of life to the present day on genealogical principles.

But if it turns out a cold epoch intervened in middle of the tertiary it would only compel us to enlarge the lapse of time allowed to the whole. I have just received the German monograph on Chilian Carabi. It is very complete. The author is of high reputation. He concludes that the 11 species form only a section of the genus although very closely allied amongst themselves & distinct as a body from all Carabi of the Northern Hemisphere. He anticipates no future discovery to modify 〈current〉 conclusions on the Geographical distribution of the genus. No Carabus has been found within the tropics & none beyond the Southern tropic in Eastern Hemisphere   He goes into many inquiries arising out of the subject but strange to say does not start the question “Whence came these isolated Chilian Carabi?” I never thought of modifications in horny genital apparatus of closely-allied Chrysomelæ being a difficulty 〈for the〉 theory.

(7 lines from bottom) instead of the short one before sent. I have now examined perfect flowers of this orchid. It is the Cynoches ventricosum. I have erred to a certain extent in my conjectures on the action of the parts. The sensitive point lies in some part of the filament of the anther, between two little leaf-like appendages on the summit of the column. The movement of the pollinium is nearly the same as in Mormodes ignea, & the anther is torn off. But the power of ejection is more feeble; & the viscid surface of the disc after the movement projects at right angles to the anther. There can be no doubt that insects either alight on, or touch, the anther or end of the column, which hangs downwards, & then the disc is flirted out, & sticks probably to their heads; but the whole pollinium is not shot to a distance as in Catasetum.

Would it not be worth while for you to look at maps of rocky mountainous countries within the Tropics. I cannot remember lakes in Brazil. How is it in Ceylon, Sumatra, the Neilgherries? Years ago I worked through all the reported cases of erratic boulders within the Tropics, & all seemed to be mere weathering of granitic rocks in situ, as shown in appendix to 1 st Edit of my Journal.— Would not something of same kind be worth your consideration? As no doubt you will attend for future to all lakes; it may possibly be worth your notice, that I always heard in T. del Fuego that sealers &c always searched for anchorage at the mouths of the deep fiords which penetrate so deeply the land; & that if they passed the bank at the mouth, no soundings could be obtained. This, I believe, is simply due to detritus there alone being formed & accumulated, from the wear of the exposed coasts on each side of entrance: during upheaval, such vast mounds of detritus might possibly bank up the water & form a lake.— No doubt the great depth of the Italian Lakes is rather a staggerer; but I think your theory must be true to very great extent & seems to me very ingenious & satisfactory. The only doubt which occurs to me is the a priori probability in a much troubled country, that some areas would be lifted up less than others & depressions thus left. I sh d . have doubted whether such irregular depressions could be detected by the lines of stratification, & perhaps in part be due to faults.— I remember years ago being struck with frequency of large lakes at base of volcanos, which fact, conjoined with frequency in all parts of world of interstratification of volcanic & lacustrine deposits, led me (together with a few other facts) to believe that very generally large areas subside at the base or near active volcanos. Might there not be same tendency near points or ranges, into which much fluid rock has been in jected, instead of e jected? Could such depressed areas be detected by stratification? An examination of several mountainous countries within the Tropics would throw much light on this doubt.— I was pleased to see your concluding sentence on cause of Glacial Period: it is an old opinion of mine, over which I have fought battles with Hooker, but never dared with Lyell.

I sh d . be very glad to have your opinion on the subject of this letter. I am led to the opinion that Drosera must have diffused matter, in organic connection, closely analogous to the nervous matter of animals. When the gland of one of the papillæ or tentacles, in its natural position (A.), is supplied with nitrogenised fluid & certain other stimulants, or when loaded with an extremely slight weight, or when struck [DIAG HERE] [DIAG HERE] several times with a needle, the pedicel bends, as shown at B, near its base, in under one minute. These varied stimulants are conveyed down the pedicel by some means: it cannot be vibration for drop of fluid put on quite quietly causes the movement: it cannot be absorption of fluid from cell to cell, for I can see rate of absorption, which though quick, is far slower, & in Dionæa the transfusion is instantanous. Analogy from animals would point to transmission through nervous matter. Reflecting on rapid power of absorption in the gland; the extreme sensibility of the whole organ, & the conspicuous movement caused by varied stimulants, I have tried a number of substances, which are not caustic or corrosive, & which I believe do not act on such organic compounds, as sugar gluten cellulose &c, but most of which are known to have a remarkable action on the nervous matter of animals. You will see the result in enclosed paper. As the nervous matter of different animals are differently acted on by the same poisons, one would not expect the same action on plants & animals; only if plants have diffused nervous matter, some degree of analogous action. And this is partially the case. Considering these experiments, together with the previously made remarks on the function of the parts, I cannot avoid the conclusion, that Drosera possesses matter at least in some degree analogous in constitution & function to nervous matter. Now do tell me what you think, as far as you can judge from my abstract. Of course many more experiments would have to be tried; but in former years I tried on whole leaf, instead of on separate glands, a number of innocuous substances such as sugar, gum, starch &c & they produced no effect.— Your opinion will aid me in deciding some future year in going on with this subject.— I sh d . not have thought it worth attempting, but I had nothing on Earth to do.— My dear Hooker | Yours very sincerely | Ch Darwin We return home on Monday 28 th thank Heaven—"

The use that I fancied could be made of Max Muller’s book,—or rather of history of language—is something more than illustration , but only a little more,—i.e. you may point to analogies of development & diversification of language—of no value at all in evidence in support of your theory, but good & pertinent as rebutting objections, urged against it.

We work hard, & persevere, and expect to come out all right,—to lay the foundations of a better future, no matter if they be laid in suffering. That will not hurt us now , and may bring great good hereafter. I never saw, and have scarcely heard of Miss Cooper’s book you ask after. She is the daughter of late J. Fenimore Cooper, the novelist. The village she describes must be Cooperstown—in the county adjacent to that in which I was brought up,—a region, which every time I visit it, I say it is the the fairest of lands, and the people the happiest. Oh—as to the weeds,—Mrs. Gray says she allows that our weeds give up to yours. Ours are modest, woodland, retiring things, and no match for the intrusive, pretentious, self-asserting foreigners. But I send you seeds of one native weed which corrupted by bad company—is as nasty and troublesome as any I know, viz.

Put the seeds directly into the ground ; they will come up in spring, in moist garden soil. My observations were made on a warm sunny day. I doubt if you have warmth and sunshine enough in England to get up a sensible movement. My note about them is in Proceed. Amer. Acad. 4, p. 98, reprinted in Sill. Jour. March, 1859, p. 277. I must own, that upon casually taking them up since, I never have obtained such very good results , as upon 2 days of Aug. 1858. Upon gourds affecting each others fruits, I have made no observations at all.

DCP-LETT-4041.xml,1863-03-15 ,1863,"Darwin, C. R.","Hooker, J. D.","Your letter will be very useful. I wish to get such passages so far in the Darwinian direction as not to be inconsistent with my general tone, and what Hooker calls some of my original arguments in favour of natural selection. At the same time I am struck by the number of compliments, both in reviews and in conversation with the half-converted, which I receive, because I have left them to draw their own inferences, and have not told them dogmatically that they must turn round with me. Hooker admits that in science people do not like to be told too plainly that they must believe, though in religion they wish to have it laid down for them. Yet he may be wrong, for if the ‘Times’ were to write for the next fortnight against the Southern States, and against the Poles, nine-tenths of good society would whirl round, and the middle class which would stand firm would be able to do so partly because they read cheaper papers which are not interested in following the lead of the ‘Times.’ .... I wish I deserved what you say about taking criticism kindly. I often think I should be as touchy as anyone if the success of my works did not give me a constant opportunity of profiting immediately by every suggestion as to style and moral tone, and above all as to facts and logic. Besides the increased responsibility which I incur by the trusting public, who before they had read a word induced the trade to bid for 3,850 copies, I have the prospect, if I improve my knowledge and my teaching, of future success in new editions with comparatively little labour. As to Lamarck I find that Grove, who has been reading him, is wonderfully struck with his book. I remember that it was the conclusion he came to about man that fortified me thirty years ago against the great impression which his arguments at first made on my mind, all the greater because Constant Prévost, a pupil of Cuvier’s forty year ago, told me his conviction ‘that Cuvier thought species not real, but that science could not advance without assuming that they were so.’ When I came to the conclusion that after all Lamarck was going to be shown to be right, that we must ‘go the whole orang,’ I re-read his book, and remembering when it was written, I felt I had done him injustice. Even as to man’s gradual acquisition of more and more ideas, and then of speech slowly as the ideas multiplied, and then his persecution of the beings most nearly allied and competing with him—all this is very Darwinian. The substitution of the variety-making power for ‘volition,’ ‘muscular action,’ &c. (and in plants even volition was not called in) is in some respects only a change of names. Call a new variety a new creation, one may say of the former as of the latter, what you say when you observe that the creationist explains nothing, and only affirms ‘it is so because it is so.’ Lamarck’s belief in the slow changes in the organic and inorganic world in the year 1800, was surely above the standard of his times, and he was right about progression in the main, though you have vastly advanced that doctrine. As to Owen in his Aye Aye paper, he seems to me a disciple of Pouchet, who converted him at Rouen to ‘spontaneous generation.’ Have I not at p. 412 put the vast distinction between you and Lamarck as to ‘necessary progression’ strongly enough? Huxley’s second thousand is going off well. If he had leisure like you and me;—and the vigour and logic of the lectures, and his address to the Geological Society, and half a dozen other recent works (letters to the ‘Times’ on Darwin, &c.), been all in one book, what a position he would occupy! I entreated him not to undertake the ‘Natural History Review’ before it began. The responsibility all falls on the man of chief energy and talent; it is a quarterly mischief, and will end in knocking him up. I am sorry you have to go to Malvern. The good of the water-cure is abstinence from work; a tour abroad would do it, I am persuaded, as effectually and more profitably. I hope my long letter will not task you too much; when I sit down to write to you, I can never stop. Hooker, not having heard from you, is growing anxious, and hopes it is because you are corresponding with me and not because of serious ill-health. Ever affectionately yours, | Charles Lyell."

When it appeared in print I feared that my views were likely to be misunderstood through the faulty conciseness of my language. A specimen of orbicular leaf has been given, (Nelumbium speciosum) but I think that I should more fully have stated that it could by no means be supposed to realize the necessary condition of the orbicular. The round leaf of the Nelumbium I take to be merely a ‘segment’, the limb of which is modified in a peculiar way, and the plane of the limb also changed with respect to its petiole. The Orbicular leaf which is ideal, must of course be supported by its axis, and therefore be a plant of itself. The round leaf given is merely to make more easy to be understood the views I put forth. The disjecta membra of the orbicular type I had intended to investigate throughout the simpler forms of vegetable life. I was anxious to show, at once, that there is mutation in forms, and proved by actual facts that changes from comparatively simple to very complex forms do take place. Figures from 9 to 21 give examples which are evident proofs to any person, even though he be not a Botanist. It was to these facts that I wished to draw your attention, and receive your opinion upon them. I thought they would naturally interest you, having read with so much pleasure your views on the ‘Origin of Species’ &c. With respect to the angle of divergence to which you are so kind as to draw my attention, it does not encourage me to undertake the investigation to say that you have failed. I confess that as yet I have been able to pay little attention to the subject. But, perhaps, you have remarked that I have perceived the angle to change for the leaflet coming off. (page 7, line 25, observations on change of direction in enlarging vein, in fig. 10, marked g .) It would be interesting to note the former angle, and the latter, comparing the difference with the progress of the leaflet in separating itself. This might give some clue. But, I do not wish to intrude crude speculations upon your attention. At present, I am not in a position to pursue the subject, but I hope soon to be so; and, assuredly, the pleasure of acting upon your suggestion would equal to the pleasure of investigating an interesting point.

I have had a bad summer, with my stomach as bad as it well can be & tomorrow we start for a month at Malvern. My wife has gone first with half the party to look for a house. We are in the same predicament, as you were, about our youngest boy, Horace who is too delicate as yet for school, & a great evil it is.— He learns nothing & what on earth we are to do about him I am sure I do not know.— You know what a hermit’s life I lead & it has been worse than ever this summer; & I have not even seen John Lubbock for months. I think everything goes on well & smoothly in the village. Today poor old Spearing was buried & I think before a year or two is over young M r Smith will follow all his family to the grave.— I am much surprised at what you say about your poor; I thought they were the best educated & moral people in Europe.— I go on working at Natural History & have taken a good deal to Botany & it is all that I am good for; I can just do an hour or two’s work, when I can do nothing else. By the way there is one sentence in your letter that utterly puzzles me, about a “Duke Darwinii” who is going to die & ought to be stuffed! I hope that you have had a day’s shooting over your own land & brought home a good bag. What a glorious day I used to think it. I have heard guns going off at a great rate all round here today & it has made me think of old times.— Your old Terrier Tartar is still alive & well, but awfully venerable in all his movements. And now I will wish you good night & with kind remembrances to M rs Innes, believe me | Dear Innes | Yours very sincerely | Ch. Darwin I do not believe a word about the toad-stories; though they must get into very queer places to cause so many strange stories.—"

Either (which you know we should like best) staying a few days with us, or coming to dine or lunch? or if you cannot do any of these are you well enough to see me? I know you will not hesitate to say so if you do not feel up to it. I am just back from a trip to Norway, Sweden, & Denmark, which we have enjoyed very much. Have you heard that they have made me President of the Ethnological Society? are you a member, if not I wish you would think of it.

Any hints or references to any particularly good or bad point in any review of you would be thankfully accepted. I hope that you are better, but heard a poor account of you yesterday from Hooker. You have of course heard of the loss which he, poor fellow, has had; we are going together to S t . Acheul on Saturday, but I expect to be back on Monday.

R.",Bibliographisches Institut,"I see my scheme for Scott has invincible difficulties & I am very much obliged to you for explaining them at such length. If ever I get decently well & Scott is free & willing I will have him here for a couple of years to work out several problems which otherwise will never be done. I cannot see what will become of the poor fellow. I enclose a little pamphlet from him which I suppose is not of much scientific value, but is surprizing as the work of a gardener   if you have time do just glance over it. I never heard any thing so extraordinary as what you say about poisoning plants &c. Very many thanks for the glacial discussion, which I shall preserve. I tho t Frankland was infinitely in his assertions Will you give Oliver my particular thanks for all his references about tendrils &c— It gives me the horrors to see how much I ought to read on the subject I can never admit Lyell’s view on glacial climate & to make all fit you will have to out do the great master of wriggling. The post has just come in   y r . interest about Scott is extraordinarily kind & I thank you cordially. It seems absurd to say so, but I suspect that Balfour is prejudiced against Scott because he partially supports my views. We will let Godfrey Wedgwood know that you wd like to see him & I am sure he wd enjoy coming out to Kew to you when next in London. It pleases me much that you wish to come here to see me but at present my health is so doubtful that it really wd not be worth while unless you were staying at the Lubbocks —for, on many days I cd only shake hands with you, & on my better days, cd only talk ten minutes— you may be sure I will let you know when I get really at all better. Apropos to glacial action I can remember no instance of fiords except in the North or South— I agree to what you say about Prestwich. Please look to climbing of Nepenthes. I am the more curious because I remember that the tips of the leaves of N. ampullacea (which I bought) were hooked— The 2 little plants which you gave me, tho’ treated with maternal care, both died. You must not trust my former letter about Clematis   I worked on too old a plant & blundered. I have now gone over the work again   It is really curious that the stiff peduncles are acted on by a bit of thread weighing .062 of a grain. Clematis glandulosa was a valuable present to me. My gardener shewed it to me & said this is what they call a Clematis evidently disbelieving it. So I put a little twig to the peduncle & the next day my gardener said “you see it is a Clem. for it feels”   That’s the way we make out plants at Down— yours affectionately | C Darwin My dear old friend | God Bless you.— Have you read the article on History of Heat in Reader: it is interesting. I have got new no r of N. Hist. Review.— I have not had it read, but I see much honour is done me, I suppose by Oliver— We have laughed over your astonishing injustice to the I. of Wight.! How curious all that you tell me about Veitch. What interesting letters you write.—"

D.","You have really done the work splendidly   I shall say in my paper that you first observed the fact & I shall give all the description on your authority. By aid of an old letter you have counted I think you have counted above 200 plants. I have looked again & I can see length of anthers is extremely variable. Theoretically the anthers of long-styled ought to be shortest & so I have generally found them If you have any flowers in bud & can spare time, open them & compare the indehissent anthers of the 2 forms, for this is of some real importance. It seemed to me that the anthers of long styled with smaller pollen-grains contain many more shrivelled & worthless grains: this theoretically ought to be so but I compared only 2 anthers the enclosed diagram will explain what I can pretty plainly see will be the result of my crosses. The case is quite new & will explain I believe a whole class of cases like that of common thyme. yrs. C.D. (Your slavey’s keep will cost about 22£ a year but that is no reason against her if she will be useful on the whole). Aunt Eliz. is coming today. yours dear W. P.S. Frank told me that some rarish Echium grew on shore near S—ampton. When in flower I sh d much like to hear about its flowers, whether dimorphic like Pulmonaria, or like our Echium, with anthers quite aborted in one form.— I sh d like to see its flowers"
DCP-LETT-4511.xml,1864-05-28 ,1864,"Darwin, C. R.","Gray, Asa","Your kindness will make you glad to hear that I am nearly as well as I have been of late years, though a good deal weaker. I have been slowly writing a paper on Lythrum, & this has disinclined me for the exertion of writing letters. It has been so pleasant doing a little work after 8 months inaction. Speaking of Lythrum reminds me to say that your Nesæas are looking very healthy, & Mitchella moderately so. Some time ago I received D r . Wrights letter about Orchids: if you write to him, beg him to note what attracts insects to Begonias? do they gnaw or penetrate the petals? Also, but I care less, what attracts them to Melastomas? Poor D r . Cruger of Trinidad, who promised to observe, is dead.— Whenever my Lythrum paper is printed I will of course send you a copy, & I shall like to hear whether you think it as curious a case as I do.— I have got another new sub -class of dimorphic plants.— An Irish nobleman on his deathbed declared that he could conscientiously say that he had never througout life denied himself any pleasure; & I can conscientiously say that I have never scrupled to trouble you.— So here goes.— Have you travelled south, & can you tell me, whether the trees, which Bignonia capreolata climbs, are covered with moss, or filamentous lichen or Tillandsia; I ask because its tendrils abhor a simple stick, do not much relish rough bark, but delight in wool or moss. They adhere in curious manner, by making little disks at end of each point, like the Ampelopsis; when the disk sticks to bundle of fibres, these fibres grow between them & then unite, so that the fibres of wool end by being embedded in middle: By the way I will enclose some specimens & if you think it worth while you can put them under the simple microscope. It is remarkable how specially adapted some tendrils are; those of Eccremocarpus scaber do not like a stick, will have nothing to say to wool; but give them a bundle of culms of grass or bundle of bristles & they seize them well.— I have been reading with great interest von Mohls paper in Bot. Zeitung on imperfect self-fertile flowers. He quotes you that perfect flowers of Voandzeia are quite sterile— How is this known, for is it not a Madagascar plant? I presume you know that wild plants of Amphicarpea are generally sterile. How I sh d . like to have seed to ascertain whether this plant is sterile when fertilised.— What a curious analogous case is that of Leersia: I have just got plants of this grass.— Please remember, if you ever come across it, seeds of the Campanula perfoliata.— Lastly (God forgive me) can you tell me whether any of your Hollies are in state of Thyme viz some plants hermaphrodites & some Females: I have a dimorphic case which, I think, will show how this state of Thyme &c arises.— Do you see the Reader: it is the best newspaper for science ever published in England: there was lately a capital article in it by Wallace. He has, also, published lately in the Anthropological Review a short, but most suggestive article on the natural selection of Man.— When inclined, do write & tell me a little about yourself & what you are doing. Is the museum for your Herbarium settled? I hope sincerely that my former fellow-sufferer M rs . Gray is quite well again.— What utter misery the stomach causes!— As for public news I am much in arrear, for I gave up for months hearing the newspaper, as I found it more fatiguing than novels. I have heard during late 9 months an astounding number of love scenes.— What dreadful carnage you have just recently suffered.— What will the end be? Will slavery perish, if so the cost is not too dear? Farewell my dear & good friend. You will see that I have regained my ten-horse-interrogoratory-power:—farewell— yours most sincerely | C. Darwin I send a Photograph of myself with my Beard. Do I not look venerable?"

DCP-LETT-4556.xml,1864-07-10 ,1864,"Darwin, C. R.","Eyton, T. C.","I enclose flowers of the two forms of two species of Ægiphila (Verbenaceæ never referred by me to Labiatæ) the long stamened marked ♂ the short stamened ♀—the two forms always on different specimens and often made two species of although admitted to differ in no other particular   Thus the long and short stamened Æ mollis are both figured by H. B. K. the former as Æ Mutisia, the latter as Æ mollis I have often observed long and short stamened forms of different plants as I believe I have frequently mentioned to you and the circumstance is so generally familiar that I do not well recollect precise instances where it is or is not. In Trichonemas which I suppose you could get seeds or bulbs of from any friends in Italy or other Mediterranean countries I have often observed it and it is (as I said in the article) made a specific character I believe there is something of the same kind in the allied genus Crocus. There are great differences in the styles and stamens in some species of Boronia as well as I could make out from dried specimens— especially I soaked a considerable number of the pinnata (Bth Fl. Austral. 1. 318) which is I believe in our gardens. Long and short stamens and styles occur I believe in several Pavettas Stylocorynas and other Rubiaceæ which A Gray also has somewhere pointed out.— There is a dimorphism in many Veronicas though I do not know whether it extends beyond the size & colour of the flowers   Many species have a form with larger blue, and another with smaller more pinkish flowers which have on that account alone been made two species of as V. fruticulosa. I have also seen it in V. teucrium, V. chamædrys and others. I have just been doing the Australian Droseras where the forms of style are infinitely varied but generally constant in the same species—and yet there is something farther to learn for in a few cases species can only or almost only be distinguished by the style as in D. Burmanni & D. spathulata D. filicaulis and D. Menziesii, D. penicilloris and D. Huegelii.— Unfortunately I cannot have so many flowers at command to examine as I could of Boronia and they are very difficult to examine dry. Another character in some species is unaccompanied by other distinctions   that is the seed either linear with the nucleus occupying the middle only or ovoid the testa not produced beyond the nucleus as between D. peltata & D. auriculata— these characters are also relied on for our own Droseras which are I believe otherwise good species.

I am daily & hourly strengthening my conviction in the field of the correctness of the view which appeals to external agency for the production of external form.— I write this from the side of Waterford Harbour after a hard tramp over some hills of trap & ash & only wish you had been well enough & strong enough to have been with me.— Believe me with all good wishes | Most sincerely yours | J. Beete Jukes.

A.","Die vielen Arbeiten, welche jedesmal der Anfang des Wintersemesters und die Einrichtung der neuen Vorlesungen mit sich bringen, haben mich bisher verhindert, Ihnen für Ihren sehr willkommenen letzten Brief zu danken. Die wichtigen Notizen, welche Sie die Güte hatten, mir über den Entstehungsgang Ihrer grossen und so höchst wichtigen Anschauungen vom Ursprung der Arten mitzutheilen, haben mich im höchsten Masse interessirt, und i〈ch〉 sage Ihnen dafür ganz besonderen Dan〈k,〉 ebenso auch meine Freunde Schleic〈her und〉 Gegenbaur , denen ich Ihren Brief mi〈tgeteilt〉 habe. Für uns Biologen ist 〈diese Mitteilung〉 zur Entwicklungs-Geschichte 〈ihrer Lehre〉 vom höchsten Werth, um so m〈ehr als Ihre Anschauungen〉 zur Entstehungs-Geschichte 〈der Arten〉 die Grundlage aller unserer 〈Erkenntniss bilden.〉 Ich spreche hier mit Gegen〈baur und Schlei〉cher jeden Tag von Ihnen u〈nd Ihrer Theorie〉 und jeden Tag finden wir neue Beweise für die Wahrheit derselben und entdecken darin neue fruchtbare Anregungen für unsere Arbeiten. Wohin ich in irgend einem Zweige der Zoologie mein Auge wende, überall ist est das Princip der gemeinsamen Abstammung, welches Licht und Verständniss in die am meisten verwickelten Puncte bringt und die schwierigsten Räthsel löst. Ganz besondere Freude empfinde ich aber zu sehen, wie Ihre Lehre allerwärts und mit jedem Tage neue Fortschritte macht und jetzt selbst 〈v〉ielfach von denen anerkannt wird, die 〈an〉fangs Ihre heftigsten Gegner waren. 〈In d〉en Monaten August und September habe ich 〈eine längere〉 Reise durch Süd-Deutschland und die 〈Schweiz gema〉cht, dabei mehrere Universitäten 〈besucht, wobei ich〉 mich selbst von der fortschreiten 〈den Verbrei〉tung der Descendenz-Theorie 〈überzeugen konnte.〉 Ein fast eben so eifrigen An〈hänger wie i〉ch selbst, ist mein Freund Édouard 〈Claparède〉 in Genf, ein ausgezeichneter Zoolog, der aber leider durch schwere und unheilbare Krankheit am Arbeiten gehindert wird. Auch Prof. Max Schultze in Bonn, unser erster Histolog, und Prof. Leuckart in Giessen, einer der besten Zoologen, haben sich jetzt zu Ihrer Anschauung bekehrt. Mehrere sehr für mich belehrende Gespräche über die verschiedenen fruchtbaren Seiten Ihrer Theorie hatte ich vor wenigen Wochen in Berlin mit Prof. Alexander Braun , einem der ausgezeichnetsten deutschen Botaniker, der trotz seiner ziemlich hohen Jahre fast in allen Stücken mit Ihnen übereinstimt. Im Übrigen finde ich, dass die Botaniker weit weniger von Ihrer Theorie wissen und auch weit weniger Interesse und Nutzen daran zu finden behaupten, als die Zoologen. Zum Theil liegt dies wohl in der Natur der Sache, da die vergleichende Anatomie und Entwicklungsgeschichte der Thiere, welche uns auf jedem Schritte neue Beweise für die volle Wahrheit der Abstammungslehre liefert, bei den Pflanzen noch nicht entfernt so weit bekannt ist. Die genealogischen Stammbäume der grossen Gruppen sind im Pflanzenreiche noch weit schwieriger herzustellen, als im Thierreich, wo ich mich jetzt mit dieser schwierigen Arbeit bei einigen Classen beschäftige. Die allgemeinere Arbeit über die Verwandschafts Verhältnisse der Thiere, von der ich Ihnen wohl schon schrieb, werde ich wohl erst in einigen Monaten beenden, da die Schwierigkeiten auf dem fast unbebauten Felde nicht gering sind und die Arbeit mir unter den Händen wächst. Ich hoffe aber, dass Ihnen dieselbe viele Freude machen wird, da ich ziemlich viele Beweise für die Wahrheit Ihrer Lehre zu liefern hoffe. Jetzt in meiner Einsamkeit, wo durch den Tod meiner Frau mein Gemüthsleben so vereinsamt ist, ist mir diese umfassende Arbeit ein grosser Trost, und ich treibe sie mit um so grösserem Eifer, als meine Anna selbst mich immer zu ihrer Ausführung antrieb und mir diese Aufgabe wie ein Vermächtniss hinterlassen hat. Meine Beobachtungen über die ausserordentliche Variabilität der Coelenteraten werde ich nun wohl erst nachher veröffentlichen. Mit grossem Interesse werden Sie die vortreffliche Arbeit von Fritz Müller : “ Für Darwin ”—gelesen haben. Dieser vorzügliche junge Zoologe ist ein geborener Pommer, jetzt Lehrer an einer Schule in Desterro (Brasilien). Er wanderte aber aus Preussen aus, weil der politische Druck dort zu sehr das freie Wort hemmt. Mein Freund Gegenbaur arbeitet jetzt die zweite Auflage seines Ihnen wohl bekannten Lehrbuchs aus: “Grundzüge der vergleichenden Anatomie” (Leipzig. 1855). Diese zweite Auflage wird er vollständig umarbeiten, da er überall das Princip der gemeinsamen Abstammung zu Grunde legen wird. Sie haben die grosse Güte, verehrtester Freund, mir ein Exemplar Ihren Balaniden-Werckes anzubieten. Ich nehme dieses Anerbieten mit dem aufrichtigsten Dan〈k〉 aus der Hand des Mannes an, dessen Ref〈orm-〉 Werck meine wissenschaftliche Richtung b〈e〉stimmt und mein Leben ausfüllen wird. Ich werde dieses Geschenk als ein theures Andenken betrachten. Die beste Gelegenheit wird sein, mir dasselbe durch die hiesige Buchhandlung von Fr. Frommann zu übersenden, welche mit Londoner Buchhändlern in Verbindung steht. Mit der Hoffnung, dass Ihre Gesundheit sich mehr und mehr bessert, und Sie uns noch lange erhalten bleiben, verbleibe ich | mit der vorzüglichsten Hochachtung | Ihr ganz ergebener | Ernst Haeckel."

What an extraordinary & self-contained life you have led! & what vigour of mind you must possess to follow science with so much ardour after all that you have undergone.— I am very much obliged for your pamphlet on Geograph. Distrib,—on Agassiz &c.— I am delighted at the manner in which you have bearded this lion in his den. I agree most entirely with all that you have written. What I meant, when I wrote to Agassiz to thank him for a bundle of his publications, was exactly what you suppose. I confess, however, I did not fully perceive how he had mistated my views; but I only skimmed through his “Method of Study” & thought it a very poor Book.— I am so much accustomed to be utterly misrepresented that it hardly excites my attention. But you really have hit the nail on the head capitally . All the younger good naturalists, whom I know think of Agassiz as you do; but he did grand service about Glaciers & Fish.— About the succession of forms, Pictet has given up his whole views, & no geologist now agrees with Agassiz.— I am glad that you have attacked Dana’s wild notions: I have a great respect for Dana, but I declare I fear that his long illness has somewhat enfeebled his brain.— If you have opportunity read in Transact. Linn. Soc. y . Bates on mimetic Lepidoptera of Amazons; I was delighted with his paper.— I have got a notice of your views about the female Cynips inserted in N. Hist. Review; whether the notice will be favourable I do know not; but anyhow it will call attention to your views.— Many thanks about the connexion of male & female insects & their organs.— It occurred to me as just possible that the organs for oviposition might be very different in allied species; & that this might lead by correlation to differences in the male parts; but this was a simple groundless conjecture on my part, & not applicable anyhow to Bombus. Would species of Bombus copulate differently? I enclose a Photograph made of me by one of my sons, & I have no other.— I wrote to Westwood for a Carte for you, but I have received no answer. I have been told that he is most bitter about species, & perhaps wishes to show his feelings by this want of common courtesy to us both.— As you allude in your paper to the believers in change of species, you will be glad to hear that very many of the very best men are coming round in Germany.— I have lately heard of Häckel, Gegenbaur, F. Müller, Leuckart, Claparede, Alex.

DCP-LETT-4810.xml,1865-04-10 ,1865,"Darwin, C. R.","Fitzgerald, R. D.","I duly received your letter along with the copies of my papers —for all the trouble about which I can only express my great indebtedness. I am quite ashamed at the time I have allowed to elapse in acknowledging the receipt of the above along with your own paper on the Lythrums —which I have read with great interest— How completely the sexual phenomena of the Lythrums casts into the shade those of the Primula, &c, which we have of late regarded as so remarkable! I have also to acknowledge receipt of Dr. Cruger’s paper on Orchids. I see Dr. Cruger attributes the sterility of the male Catasetum to a deficiency in the conducting tissue. My experiments results on the Gongoras & Acroperas illustrates this view, inasmuch as I have found a gradual decrease in the amount of fertility according to the amount I cut from the column in inserting the pollen-masses. This is further illustrated by the fact that in those cases in which the capsule did not set when I had cut largely from the column—I invariably found that a sufficiency of pollen-tubes were developed, showing us that the power of stimulating the full developement of the ovules does not, at least in every case reside innately, & independently in the pollen. I should have liked if Dr. Cruger had entered more fully into the fertilisation of Gongora   He has said nothing as to the contraction of the stigmatic cavity! I have not as yet had an opportunity of examining many of the species —but all that I have seen, exhibit the same contracted characteristics—and of course it would have been utterly impossible for an insect—I am inclined to think—to insert the pollinia— Fertilisation in these could only have been effected in the manner described by Dr. Cruger by a large developement of the viscous matter around the mouth of the stigma as I formerly supposed. I should like much to have time & opportunities to re-commence experiments on the above. At present I have neither being kept very busy indeed with the Cinchonas Whether or not I remain here much longer I really cannot say. I rather think that I will go down to the Calcutta Botanic Gardens, as Curator, Dr. Anderson having offered it me, & appears desirous that I should take it for a short time. I expected that I would have known definitely ere this whether I should go or not, Dr. Anderson having promised to pay us a visit here in the latter end of March. I trust my other letters and paper on Verbascums have come duly to hand, as I have not had the pleasure of hearing from you since the date of their arrival. I have to express my best thanks for your remarks upon composition. I can assure you, I well know the need of improving myself—but alas! for my powers. I am most completely awanting in the powers of expression, so that my highest source of happiness, affords me the greatest pain. I was sorry to hear of the old bye law which prevents my election as an Associate of the Linnean Society. I should have indeed liked much to have had that honour conferred upon me. But now of course it can’t be helped. I am much pleased to find that Prof. A. Gray has noticed my paper— I expected that he would have something to say on the N.A. Hottonia inflata .

I will be glad if I have a letter from you soon, & find that I can possibly be of any service to you here, should it be that I have to go to Calcutta. In case this should be, when you are pleased to write me again, will you kindly address to the care of D r . Anderson as formerly.

Dezember und auch Ihr “Journal of Researches”, wofür ich Ihnen noch meinen aufrichtigen Dank sagen darf. Ich lese das Buch jetzt mit ausserordentlichem Interesse. Sie bemerken (S. 30), dass bei all den verschiedenen Arten von leuchtenden Thieren, welche Sie beobachtet haben, das Licht von deutlich grüner Farbe gewesen ist. Ich habe dieselbe Beobachtung gemacht bei Seethieren (Renilla, Noctiluca, Beroë u. s. w.), aber bei den Insecten giebt es einige Ausnahmen. Die verschiedenen Arten von leuchtenden Elateren, welche ich gesehen habe, besitzen ausser den beiden Lichtern am Thorax noch einen leuchtenden Fleck an der Bauchseite des ersten Hinterleibsegments; wenn das Insect in Ruhe ist oder umherkriecht, so ist dieser Fleck nicht sichtbar; er wird aber sichtbar, sobald der Hinterleib in die Höhe gebogen wird oder wenn der Elater fliegt. Das Licht dieses Flecks ist sogar heller als das der beiden anderen und von gelber Farbe, sehr verschieden von dem grünlichen Licht der Thorax-Flecken. .... . Eine kleine Art von Elater hat zwei leuchtende Punkte mehr, welche wie diejenige der Glühwürmer an dem hinteren Theil des Abdomen gelegen sind. Ungefähr vor 12 Jahren fand ich in dem Urwalde am Itajahy-Fluss eine sehr merkwürdige leuchtende Käferlarve, welche leuchtende Flecke an allen ihren Leibesringeln hatte; einige von diesen Flecken (wenn ich mich recht entsinne, diejenigen des Vorderendes) waren von leuchtendem Roth, einige waren gelb, und der grösste Theil grün. Die Larve konnte alle oder auch einige von ihren leuchtenden Flecken verdunkeln; wenn sie gereizt wurde, so strahlten alle ein prächtiges Licht aus. Die Larve scheint sehr selten zu sein; mein Bruder, der am Itajahy seit 1852 lebt, hat sie nur ein einziges Mal gefunden. Es ist mir sehr schmeichelhaft, dass Sie meine Bemerkungen über Kletterpflanzen für werth gehalten haben, der Linnaean Soc. vorgelegt zu werden. .... . Im letzten Monat habe ich drei Wochen zu einer Reise nach dem Itajahy-Fluss verwendet, wo ich mich wiederum an der Pracht unserer Urwälder erfreute. Ich sah mich nach Kletterpflanzen um; aber ich habe nur einen einzigen Fall von einer Pflanze bemerkt, welche einen dicken Stamm erkletterte (ungefähr 5 Fuss im Umfang); nach dem Bau des Holzes und dem bitteren Geschmack glaube ich, dass es eine Menispermee war; sie hatte ungefähr 3 Zoll Durchmesser und kletterte in einer lockeren Spirale von links nach rechts. Die meisten Kletterpflanzen, welche dicke Bäume erstiegen, waren Wurzelklimmer (Farne, Aroideen, Begonia u. s. w.); ich fand auch einige Rankenklimmer (Haplolophium, Bignonia, Cissus u. s. w.).— Am oberen Itajahy sah ich zahlreiche schwarze Schnüre (von einigen Linien bis zu beinah ein Zoll Durchmesser[)], spiralig um die Stämme einiger mächtigen Bäume gewunden, und ich glaubte zuerst, es wären Kletterpflanzen, welche die Bäume erstiegen; später aber fand ich, dass es Luftwurzeln waren von einem Philodendron, welches auf den Zweigen jener Bäume lebte und von dort die Wurzeln nach der Erde sandte. Es giebt einige andere Arten von Philodendron, deren Luftwurzeln immer frei von den Zweigen herunterhängen und senkrecht zur Erde wachsen, wobei sie oftmals eine Länge von mehr als 50 m erreichen. .... . Was Orchideen anbetrifft, so habe ich die gute Gelegenheit, Arten aus all den verschiedenen Gruppen zu beobachten und so viele von den wundervollen Anpassungen zu sehen, welche in Ihrem Orchideen-Buch beschrieben sind, und mich so von der Richtigkeit Ihrer Beobachtungen zu überzeugen.... ."

I quite agree that Agassiz could never mistake weathered-blocks & glacial action; though the mistake has, I know, been made in 2 or 3 quarters of the world. I have often fought with Hooker about the Physicists putting their veto on the world having been cooler; it seems to me as irrational, as if, when Geologists first brought forward some evidence of elevation & subsidence, a former Hooker had declared that this c d not possibly be admitted until Geologists c d explain what made the earth rise & fall. It seems that I erred greatly about some of the plants on the Organ M ts ., but I am very glad to hear about Fuchsia &c. I cannot make out what Hooker does believe, he seems to admit the former cooler climate, & almost in the same breath, to spurn the idea. To retort Hooker’s words “It is inexplicable to me” how he can compare the transport of seeds from the Andes to the Organs M ts . with that from a continent to an island: not to mention the much greater distance, there are no currents of water from one to the other, & what on earth sh d make a bird fly that distance without resting many times. I do not at all suppose that nearly all tropical forms were exterminated during the cool period, but in somewhat depopulated areas, into which there c d be no migration, probably many closely allied species will have been formed since this period. Hooker’s paper in Nat. Hist. Rev. is well worth studying; but I cannot remember that he gives good grounds for his conviction that certain orders of plants c d not withstand a rather cooler climate, even if it came on most gradually. We have only just learnt under how cool a temperature several tropical Orchids can flourish. I clearly saw Hookers difficulty about the preservation of tropical forms during the cool period, & tried my best to retain one spot after another as a hot-house for their preservation; but it w d not hold good, & it was a mere piece of truckling on my part when I suggested that longitudinal belts of the world were cooled one after the other. I shall very much like to see Agassiz’ letter whenever you receive one. I have written a long letter; but a squabble with or about Hooker always does me a world of good, & we have been at it many a long year. I cannot quite understand whether he attacks me as a Wriggler or a Hammerer but I am very sure that a deal of wriggling has to be done. With many thanks | yours affectionately | Charles Darwin"

I must have expressed myself badly for you to suppose that I look at islands being stocked by occasional transport as a well established hypothesis: we both give up creation & therefore have to account for the inhabitants of islands either by continental extensions or by occasional transport; now all that I maintain is that of these two alternatives, one of which must be admitted notwithstanding very many difficulties, that occasional transport is by far the most probable. I go thus far further that I maintain, knowing what we do, that it w d . be inexplicable if unstocked isl ds were not stocked to certain extent at least, by these occasional means.— European birds are occasionally driven to America but far more rarely than in the reverse direction: they arrive viâ Greenland (Baird): yet a European lark has been caught in Bermuda. By the way you might like to hear that European birds regularly migrate, viâ the Northern Islands, to Greenland. About the erratics in the Azores see Origin p. 393: Hartung c d hardly be mistaken about granite blocks on a volcanic island.

I have the particulars of one case in which one var. of common pea was raised for a number of generations near other peas and yet kept true. From the action of Bees and from analogy the whole case perplexes me much. Perhaps if you come across any nursery gardener you will enquire whether they have actually known adjoining vars. to cross.

DCP-LETT-5438.xml,1867-03-11 ,1867,"Darwin, C. R.","Hooker, J. D.","I promised when you were here to look up a few cases of sexual ornamentation &c in insects & send the particulars to you. Here they are. 1. Gay-coloured butterflies. The tropical American genus Epicalia is a good case. The males are amongst the most gaudy of all butterflies; the females are generally very plain. I know both sexes of 12 species: in one both sexes are similar in pattern & colours & this pattern is that of the great majority of the females of the genus; in 9 other species the two sexes are so different that Entomologists formerly placed them in separate genera, but the male of one of the 9 is totally different in colours & pattern from the other 8 males although as gaily coloured as they; in the remaining 2 species both males & females are gaily coloured but males more so than females. I think this case will interest you; the fact of the females of 10 species being of the same type of colouration gives us a clue to the ancestral type, from which the males have diverged by sexual selection, & this type is that of both sexes in several allied genera found in various parts of the world. The fact, again, of 2 species having females gaily-coloured & very different from the females of the rest of the species points to the inheritance of gay colours being partaken of by both sexes in the two species whilst in the rest male has inherited male colours & female female. The males & females in this genus do not frequent separate haunts as in many other genera; but the females fly slower & nearer the ground than the males. The facts afforded by Epicalia are not isolated in Entomology— other genera & natural groups of species within genera afford similar illustrations. In some genera when the males are much more gaily coloured than their females   the males are immeasurably more numerous than the females & spend most of their days in the open sunlight whilst their obscurer partners are confined to the shade of the woods (Genera, Catagramma, Eunica, Megistanis &c). In other cases the females have clearly diverged from the Common type of coloration while the males have remained unchanged in this respect; groups of species of Pieris come under this category. 2 Armature of males. I have looked through my collection of horned genera of Lamellicorn beetles; viz, Copris, Phanæus and Onthophagus and find 5 specimens with their cephalic horns broken or edge of clypeus chipped. As we generally select perfect specimens in collecting this is only an indication of what might be found if attention was drawn to the subject. The male horns & thoracic bosses are so wonderfully developed in many species that they must have been drawn out by a long course of Natural Selection & therefore must be of some use to the species; but no one has yet recorded, to my knowledge, a case of males fighting: true, the species come out of their holes only at night. Excessive variability in size of horns & bosses I find is the rule, but not a rule without exceptions. For instance, the most wonderfully horned species of Onthophagus in the world viz. O. rangifer of the Zambezi region, shows in ab t . 100 specimens I have inspected (collected at random by a non-Entomologist) shew no imperfectly developed males; the female is without armature in this species. The rule in Onthophagus is, however, a gradual degradation of horns &c. from fully-developed males down to males so degenerate that they are scarcely to be distinguished from females. Another fact is that the species in Onthophagus cannot be naturally classed according to the horns of the male: in each natural group of species there are species with one cephalic horn & others with a pair, like the bull. In Phanæus & Copris there are species with horned females scarcely to be distinguished from degenerate males. If you wish to ask me any more special questions about these matters, I shall be glad to try to answer them Yours sincerely | H W Bates Wallace brought forward your enquiry regarding gay caterpillars before the Entomological Society last Meeting & several practical men are looking out for explanations."

It is so very difficult to get the technical terms for many breeds which are either unknown in Germany or only described in pamphlets or periodicals unknown or inaccessible to me. You mention a breed of the game-fowl as “Duckwings”. Now first of all, game-fowl is the race of the “fighting cocks”; isn’t it? I imagine “duckwing” means having similar markings on the wings as the wild duck. Am I right? What then is “Piles”? The Hamburgh breed has “spangled” and “pencilled” forms. Is “spangled” synonymous or pretty nearly so with “shining”? I think “pencilled” is something like “marked with narrow short lines”, what we should call “gestrichelt”. Does any technical, zoological term exist for hackles ? I know these feathers, but as you speak of hackles in the loins, I think there ought to be a more general name for this kind of feathers. The 13 th . breed of your list is the Sooty fowl. I find in “ Drechsler , die Zucht-Hühner” a breed called negro-fowl. I rather doubt if these two breeds are the same, as you say, that the hens alone are characterized so as you describe the breed; but I find no other breed in any way agreeing with your description.

I am very much obliged to you for your kindness in having sent me the German version of the forth edition of your work on species. I have read several months ago the original of this forth edition and have been as much pleased as surprised at the plenty of new important evidences your theorie has gained since the first German edition has been published. It has been a great pleasure to me to receive now out of your own hand your work together with your portrait. Being by no means able to return my thanks to you by any however unimportant own work I can only send to you my portrait. A single observation made by me several weeks ago perhaps could be of some interesting to you. I have never heard or read that Dipterous insects take other than fluid food. Therefore I was surprised by seing that Eristalis tenax, Rhingia rostrata, different species of Syrphus and many other Dipterous insects eat enorm quantities of pollen grains. With Eristalis tenax I was allowed long time to look at its eating in immediate nearness, and to convince myself that the complicate structure of its underlip is admirably adapted as well to this foot as to the sucking of nectar. [DIAG HERE] The two flaps on the free end of the underlip clasp little clusters of pollen grains between them and grind them behind by quick alternate porrections and retractions. The numerous horny cross-ledges on the inner side of the two flaps serve to seize, to hold and to shove behind the single pollengrains The distance of these horny ledges apparently is adapted to the greatness of the pollengrains. For I found the stomach of Eristalis tenax filled for the greatest part with many hundred thousands of the large pollen grains of an Oenothera cultivated in my garden; whilst the stomach of Syrphus balteatus (which species has narrower cross ledges on the underlip) contained only much lesser pollengrains When sucking the fly put the ends of their bristle shaped mandibles (not represented in my drawing) between the two flaps, thus giving to them a fixed direction and then draws back the lateral portions C. The cold season has finished to early my just begun observations. It will be, I believe, an interesting proposing to compare accurately the structure of the underlip of stinging and exclusively sucking Dipterons with those who besides eat pollen and to search generally what details of structure the mouth of the flower-visiting insects of all orders has gained in the struggle for existence, in the purpose to attain better the food offered by the flowers. For the complet understanding of the complicate structure of the mouth of Dipterons it is, I believe, indispensable to take notice of its adaption to pollen-food. If you know any observations published on this object I whould be glad of hearing where they are published. With the greatest respect and my sincere thanks I remain, dear Sir, | yours very faithfully | Hermann Müller."

DCP-LETT-5826.xml,1868-02-17 ,1868,"Darwin, C. R.","Lubbock, John","My observations were intended to apply to “ Gammarus marinus ” the common dull green species on the sea shore— When I have taken a quantity of these to-gether I have invariably found the adult males to be considerably fewer in number than the females. It may be that among the many, that I took to be females some were males not fully mature, but the mature males are larger than the females. This reminds me that I have noticed that occasionally the adult males assume a yellow ish color. I do not remember ever having found a female other than olive green. I said that Gammarella has I thought large hands in the male, small in the female— I certainly think that in crustacea females are decidedly more abundant than males   I can only give my opinion as on British, because exotic, specimens are generally selected by the collectors & the finest & most peculiar are taken— Thus in a bottle of Gelasimi that I have just opened from Singapore I find five males & one female   I have little doubt but that the collector (D r Collingwood) chose those that had the large claws as being the more interesting— In These Gelasimi, which I have only observed since I last wrote, I find that the Great claw is invariably of a Salmon color along the under or immovable finger. Now in the (one) female I find no color what ever, except the universal green which may be a shade lighter than that of the male. The specimens are in spirits. According to my experience the large claw is invariably on the Right side. I think every author so figures it except Milne Edw. & I should have thought his to have been the result of the engravers forgetting to reverse the figure, but that M r Edwards says, that it is “sometimes on the right side & sometimes on the left”. The right side is undoubtedly the more constant The left or small hand is as far as my experience goes of the same form as those of the female & these are both alike. My belief is that should the male in a young state lose or injure the right or large hand, why! then the left may develope itself into the more powerful organ— In retiring into a hole the large hand must block up the hole from its size: therefore I do not see the weight of M. Edwards quotation of M. Marion de Procé. You are probably aware that in some Gelasimi the hand can be of no use in feeding itself in as much, that the claw is so large that it cannot be brought to reach the mouth— In this Singapore species before me, the hand passes far beyond the mouth, [DIAG HERE] the fingers moreover can only meet at the apex & which apex cannot be brought near the mouth. In the common shore crab “Carcinus mænas” copulation takes place when the female has cast its shell & is in a soft state, previously the male carries her about hugged close under him, the dorsum of the female against the sternum of the male but in this act I have seen some of the smaller legs passed round the female, & if the larger ones are used they only embrace the female, not bite her. During copulation she being soft would be liable to injury from the compression of the nippers— Besides the chelæ are free for defensive protection. I think the male catches the female with the chelæ but holds her with his arms & legs. They, if left alone, lie quietly, but if disturbed the male runs actively, carrying the female with him. I think I am correct in asserting possitively that the females are the more abundant & have smaller claws in the following species Porcellana longicornis Cancer pagurus. Porcellana platycheles Eurymone aspera Galathea andrewsii Corystes cassivelaunus Among the Portunidæ or swimming crabs the size of the chelæ are nearly of one size in the two sexes. I think that this holds good among most of the larger swimming crustacea, such as prawns &c You may use my statements as you think proper. They are based upon personal observation, but I have never numerated the proportions but merely state my recollection & impressions Believe me my dear Sir | Yours very sincerely C Spence Bate"

I fancied I recollected having seen very fine fibres or ciliæ which might account for it. But a more careful examination under the microscope leaves little doubt in my mind that it is the quasi-metallic reflexion exhibited by certain colouring matters having very intense power of absorption. Murexide and platinocyanide of Magnesium are good examples, or to take substances more easily procured carthamine, which is sold in the form of the so-called pink saucers, and several of the analine colours, rosanaline for instance. If you pour 2 or 3 drops of a solution, tolerably pure, of these colouring matters on glass and allow it to evaporate, a film is left which is one colour by transmitted light and another by reflected light, and the reflected colour has that metallic aspect seen in the peacock’s tail. The leaflets, if I may so call them, of the feather (I describe the feather as a bipinnate leaf and speak of the 2 ndary leaflets i.e. the leaflets of the primary divisions) of the peacocks tail feathers, in those places where the feather shows that beautiful metallic green, are red by transmitted light.

The ♀ of Orgyia antiqua in the imago state never leaves the cocoon but as it deposits its eggs, it is often nearly an inch in length with the abdomen very much distended with ova, it is conspicuous on palings & seems a nice fat mouthful for an insectivorous bird, but by the birds in my aviary it was universally refused.— It is to be noted that my birds were very tame & were constantly on the lookout for insects to be thrown to them, they would take without hesitation Woodlice, Centipedes, Millipedes Geodephagous Beetles, Cockroaches (Blattæ), Weevils (Curculionidæ & with avidity Spiders.— The latter much surprizes me, but they like nothing better, but in nature the spiders seem protected, perhaps by their webs?— Yours very truly | J Jenner Weir C Darwin Esq r ."

I have carefully kept your previous note, in which you spoke doubtfully about Bell’s statement. I intended in my former note only to express a wish that if during your professional work, you were led to open the eyelids of a screaming child, you would specially observe this point about the eye showing signs of becoming gorged with blood, which interests me extremely .— Could you ask anyone to observe this for me in an eye-dispensary or Hospital? But I now have to beg you kindly to consider one other question, at any time when you may have half an hours leisure.— When a man coughs violently from choking, or retches violently, even when he yawns, & when he laughs violently, tears come into the eyes. Now in all these cases I observe that the orbicularis muscle is more or less spasmodically contracted, as also in the crying of a child. So again when the muscles of the abdomen contract violently in a propelling manner, & the breath is, I think, always then held, as during the evacuation of a very costive man, & as (I hear) with a woman during severe labour-pain the orbicularis contracts & tears come into the eyes. Sir J. E. Tennant states that tears roll down the cheeks of elephants when screaming & trumpeting at first being captured: accordingly I went to Zoolog. Gardens, & the keeper made 2 Elephants trumpet, & when they did this violently the orbicularis was invariably plainly contracted. Hence I am led to conclude that there must be some relation between the contraction of this muscle & the secretion of tears.— Can you tell me what this relation is? Does the orbicularis press against, & so directly stimulate the lachrymal glands? As a slight blow on the eye causes by reflex action a copious effusion of tears, can the slight spasdomic contraction of the orbicularis act like a blow; this seems hardly possible.— Does the same nerve which runs to the orbicularis send off fibrils to the lachrymal glands; & if so, when the order goes for the muscle to contract is nervous force sent sympathetically at the same time to the glands? I sh d be extremely much obliged if you 〈would〉 have the 〈great〉 kindness to give me your opinion on this point.— Pray believe me | My dear M r Bowman | Yours very sincerely | Ch. Darwin"

DCP-LETT-6146.xml,1868-04-30 ,1868,"Darwin, C. R.","Hooker, J. D.","Your letter, like so many previous ones, has interested me much.— D r . Allbutt’s view occurred to me some time ago & I have written a short discussion on it. It is, I think, a remarkable law, to which I have found no exception. The foundation lies in the fact, that in many cases the eggs or seeds require nourishment & protection by the mother-form for some time after impregnation. Hence the spermatozoa & antherozoids travel in the lower aquatic animals & plants to the female, & pollen is borne to the female organ. As organisms rise in the scale it seems natural that the male sh d carry the spermatozoa to the female in his own body. As the male is the searcher he has received & gained more eager passions than the female; &, very differently from you, I look at this as one great difficulty in believing. that the males select the more attractive females; as far as I can discover they are always ready to seize on any female & sometimes on many females.— Nothing would please me more than to find evidence of males selecting the more attractive females: I have for months being trying to persuade myself of this. There is the case of man in favour of this belief, & I know in hybrid unions of males preferring particular females, but alas not guided by colour.— Perhaps I may get more evidence, as I wade through my 20 years mass of notes. I am not shaken about the female protected butterflies; I will grant (only for argument) that the life of the male is of very little value,— I will grant that the males do not vary, yet why has not the protective beauty of the female been transferred by inheritance to the male? The beauty would be a gain to the male, as far as we can see, as a protection; & I cannot believe that it w d be repulsive to the female as she became beautiful.— But we shall never convince each other. I sometimes marvel how truth progresses, so difficult is it for one man to convince another, unless his mind is vacant. Nevertheless I myself to a certain extent contradict my own remark; for I believe far more in the importance of protection, than I did before reading your articles.— I do not think you lay nearly stress enough in your articles on what you admit in your letter, viz “there seems to be some production of vividness of colour in the male independent of protection”. This I am making a chief point; & have come to your conclusion so far that I believe that intense colouring in the female sex is often checked by being dangerous.— That is an excellent remark of yours about no known case of male alone assuming protective colours; but in the cases in which protection has been gained by dull colours, I presume that sexual selection would interfere with the male losing his beauty. If the male alone had acquired beauty as a protection, it would be most readily overlooked, as males are so often more beautiful than their females. Moreover I grant that the life of the male is somewhat less precious & thus there w d . be less rigorous selection with the male, so he w d . be less likely to be made beautiful through natural selection for protection.* But it seems to me a good argument, & very good if it could be thoroughily established. Yours most sincerely | C. Darwin * This does not apply to sexual selection, for the greater the excess of males & the less precious their lives, so much the better for sexual selection. I do not know whether you will care to read this scrawl PS I heard yesterday that my Photograph has been sent to your London address—Westbourne Grove"
DCP-LETT-6153.xml,1868-05-01 ,1868,"Darwin, C. R.","Innes, J. B.","I will confine myself to answering a few of your objections while the subject is on my mind. Your explanation of the male seeking female is good, & your argument from it good too, as far as it goes. Has the free pairing of Pigeons been carefully watched? I hardly see your difficulty or your objection to the case of the ♀ protected butterflies. You argued before (& have proved) that, “ characters appearing in one sex are sometimes transmitted to that sex exclusively ”. The cases of these ♀ protected butterflies (by mimicry) are so few that we may well suppose the proper variations to have occurred sufficiently in that sex only. But there is also this important fact to be considered, that in most (perhaps all) these cases the ♀ has different habits, & the same variation would not be useful to the male, because he does not frequent the stations where the mimicked species abounds. He also has a strength of flight which does not accord with the slow weak flight of the Heliconidæ , while that of the ♀ does. In cases where this difference of habit & action does not exist both sexes are equally protected , as in the leaf butterfly ( Kallima inachis ) which is protected in repose. Can you understand how it is that the female African Elephant has tusks the Indian not ? Are they useful to the one female, useless to the other? Why have some female ruminants horns others not? We cannot explain every individual case, because we cannot know all the existing and past conditions of any case, but we must decide on the mass of cases explained by & the difficulties in the way of, each view. There is a very important fact with regard to the male intensity of colour that puts it in quite a different class from sexually selected or protective colouring, & that is, that the more deeply coloured male is almost always smaller , so that it is really the same amount of colour concentrated on a smaller surface. This is the case in almost all butterflies & moths , and beetles ,—also in Hawks. Where the female is equal or smaller in size the colour (if the same) is generally equally intense. I speak now from memory only, but I think you will find this a pretty correct statement of the facts. I do not maintain that this explains all the difference of depth & intensity of colour. Part may be due to greater vigour of male or be correlated with his sexual organs. I do not understand what is your explanation of the female mimicking Pieris. Do you consider it inexplicable? My theory of colour in nature is somewhat as follows: 1: Colour is ever varying, and is generally transmitted to both sexes. 2. It protects, by simple concealment. "" by mimicry. "" by making conspicuous. 4. It is useful also sexually, to the male by attracting the female;— perhaps to the female by attracting the male. 5. It is therefore selected & accumulated. 6. Owing to the special structure functions & habits of the female sex, this often requires more protection than the male, and is also of more importance in the preservation of the offspring. Protection by colour is therefore often acquired by this sex alone. 7. This occurs either by subduing or checking the colour as acquired by the male, or by the accumulation of entirely distinct colours & markings. I really do not think we shall ultimately differ much on this point. Yours very faithfully | Alfred R. Wallace Many thanks for the Photo."

After the discredit which has been thrown upon the French statements I hope you will be very careful, for I must confess I cannot help being sceptical, & therefore I ought not to be honoured by my name being attached to these animals, which if they really are hybrids are by far the most wonderful ever produced.

Next, about cuckoos. It is the barred upper rather than the “under surfaces” which you must mean. Well, then, there is the hepaticus plumage of C. canorus , rare in this species and probably confined to the female sex; it being a repetition of the barred nestling dress. In C. striatus (apud Schlegel, vide “Ibis,” 1866, p. 359), this hepatic plumage is more common, and still more so in C. poliocephalus (which is figured in this dress erroneously as C. himalayanus in Gould’s “Century of Himalayan Birds”). In C. Sonneratii this nestling-like hepatic colouring is permanent , there being no ashy phase as in the others. Thirdly, the first plumage of the crossbills is striated , very like that of a redpole, or of a hen siskin,—and the same remark applies to the young goldfinch and greenfinch, which species are streakless when adult. Does not Yarrell figure the young of the crossbill in his ‘British Birds’? The turacos constitute the exclusively African family Musophagidæ , comprising Musophaga , Turacus , (see Corythaix ), Schizorhis , and (in my opinion, but as a distinct subfamily ,) Colius . Musophaga and Turacus are united by Schlegel, and these are the birds to which I especially referred as “turacos”. However long ago I ventured upon the remark that the sexes are alike in these three families ( Musophagidæ , Capitonidæ , and Rhamphastidæ , the two latter being very nearly allied), it still holds to the best of my information, unless there may be an exception or two in the S. American genus Capito , about which consult Sclater. In fact you had better ask him in the following words to prevent any confusion —“Do you know of any Musophagidæ , Rhamphastidæ , or Capitonidæ , (inclusive of Mægalæmidæ ), in which the sexes differ in plumage”? The name Bucco formerly included the Capitonidæ , but is now transferred to the very distinct S. American group formerly styled Tamatia with its kindred genera— Yours very truly, | E Blyth"

I have unfortunately very little to say— As regards expression I can at present answer but one query. The head is shaken laterally in negative & nodded in affirmative among the Gold Coast tribes. I find it exceedingly difficult to seize expressions if not prepared for them (as one w d . be in case of a surgical operation). Expression is sudden & momentary— In smiling by the bye I observed two crescent wrinkles at the corners of the mouth, concave side nearest mouth— However I shall try to get something more in that way for you There is one breed of sheep only on the Gold Coast (where I have spent most of my time since coming out). The rams have horns & manes: the females neither. When castrated not only horns but hair is affected. I have frequently asked about the age at wh. the horns sprout but c d . get no answer. Europeans out here do not observe such things, & the blacks have no idea of time. However I have set three persons to watch, & hope to get a reply on my return from the interior, wh. will be in a few months. There is a breed with both sexes horned in Senegambia (with dewlaps) and another breed of enormous size in the Niger Country in wh. the female has rudimentary horns. Women in Africa at all events among the more intelligent pagan tribes have no difficulty about getting the husbands they want, although it is considered unwomanly to ask a man to marry them, & that on the Gold Coast I am informed they never do— They are quite capable of falling in love, and even of forming tender passionate and faithful attachments. As a rule tribes do not intermarry but I have little doubt that there are many exceptions. Women do not like to marry strangers visiting their country because they do not like to leave their own families; on the other hand when a Foula or Mandingo comes among the Soosovo or Timmanies (pagan coast tribes in this neighbourhood) they try to make him settle & marry amongst them. They like to breed from superior men that the offspring may be of use to the town a fact rather opposed to the vulgar ideas about African want of foresight. Girls are not forced to marry the choice of the family in certain tribes: in others (of a lower kind) she is   The intermarriage-between-tribes question is an important one. I shall pay attention to it. I am not likely to see the gorilla up here. At present it is only found a little above Cape S t . John and Loango.

I want much to study the Upper Niger & Haussa Country before I leave Africa but cannot tell whether I shall have the opportunity. I am not likely however to return home just yet. Any queries you may send to me shall be faithfully attended to, as far as lies in my power.

Certainly my impression is strong that the shelves themselves are now, except when crossed by a rill, just as they were when they bordered the lake or water.— One is led to suspect that Crolls & Geikies estimate of the amount of surface degradation, is much too high, even supposing that the amount of loose matter now carried away by the rivers is correct.— Somehow I cannot persuade myself that the Glacial period was much more recent than hitherto supposed.

DCP-LETT-6697.xml,1869-04-15 ,1869,"Darwin, C. R.","Egan, James","I was much obliged for your kind 〈le〉tter & for the suggestions it contained. I sh d . 〈ha〉ve acknowledged it earlier but that I have been little able to write. I have sought out your letter written many years ago to me about Melastomes. I find it asks for information chiefly about any dimorphism of the sexual organs, such as you have observed in the allied order of Lythraceæ. I recollect looking through my notes in vain for any record of such structure. The baccate Melastomaceæ, such as I chiefly gathered, have stamens remarkably equable in length, although usually in a double row. The filaments and anthers, white in some, yellow in others, are apt to turn rose and even purple after shedding their pollen, which (in these species) is 〈n〉ever green. The only observation I have preserved about their fertilisation you will find in my ‘Report on Expedition to procure Red Bark Tree’; but as it is unlikely you should have a copy of that Report I will copy it here. “The first plant which took my attention at Limon, 〈af〉ter the Cinchona, was a beautiful epiphytal Blakea , 〈gro〉wing from 12 to 18ft high with large coriaceous 〈lea〉ves & large rose-coloured flowers. At the base of 〈the〉 flower is a turgid involucre, of four large orbicular, widely & closely imbricated leaves, within which is secreted a limpid fluid. When the corolla falls away, the involucral leaves close firm〈ly〉 over the calyx, and do not open out, nor does the contained fluid dry up, until the globose ro〈s〉eate be〈  〉 the size of a pea, is quite ripe. Another singu〈lar〉 character is the syngenesious anthers, with a minu〈te〉 pore at the apex of each cell, through which not a g〈rain〉 of pollen ever escapes, as I satisfied myself by repeated observation; fertilisation being effected through the agency of minute beetles, which abound in the flowers, and eat away the inner edge of the anther-cells—probably part of the pollen also.” This is what I wrote on the spot, but I have no doubt now that the pollen, liberated by the beetles, falls on the honeyed disk, whence it is carried off by winged insects & deposited on the stigmas of other flowers; for the stigma hangs out far beyond both petals & stamens, therefore out of reach of the pollen as it falls into the centre of the flower. It is noteworthy that in this most geometrical of of all orders of flowering-plants—for the strongl〈y〉 ribbed leaves, often purple beneath, closely wired with the numerous parallel veins between the ribs, have reminded me of some delicate fabric of copper or cast-iron—the only departure from symmetry is in the style going out between the filaments on one side, so that the stigma becomes quite excentric to the flower   Sometimes the stamens are slightly declinate in the same direction as the style.* I have observed t〈hat〉 flies alighting on the flower use the large pelta〈te〉 stigma as a support for their hind legs whilst poking their noses into the disk. Surely here is an 〈i〉nstance of the effects of direct mechanical action 〈o〉n the part of insects, the style having become declinate through this perpetual “sagging” (as we say in Yorkshire, 〈but a〉s Shakespeare says it too I suppose the word is 〈go〉od English). When I have seen flies tugging & poking at the 〈s〉iphon-like corollas of some Gardoquias, Salvias, Siphocampyli, &c. I have said to myself “Surely these flowers have become arcuate through the long-continued action of the flies.” I have not by me your charming book on the Fertilisation of Orchids, but I thought you had admitted in part the direct agency of insects in modifying the structure of the flowers. When my paper is printed I will take care not to attribute to you any opinions you do not really hold. Does not Natural Selection balance all internal & external influences, to the good of the individual, as 〈f〉ar as may be; and when opposing agencies become too strong for it, still keep up the struggle (as it were) to the last gasp? There are some structures which (so far as we can see) are neither beneficial nor otherwise to plants and animals in their struggle for life. Such may b〈e〉 the sacs on the leaves of Tococas, which perhaps 〈  〉 not have attained to permanence except in a 〈reg〉ion where the climate scarcely varies throughout the year. If a gall were always to appear in the same part of a plant—if it could be permanently tenanted—if it c d . be proved not prejudicial but possibly eve〈n〉 beneficial to the plant—I do not see why it shou〈ld〉 not become hereditary. I have many times seen sacs on Tococa-leaves even full-grown ones—that were imperforate an〈d〉 therefore untenanted by ants: that alone proves t〈he〉sacs to be inherited. I sh d . think instances of th〈is〉 might be found on my specimens at Kew. I wish 〈I〉 had them here & c d . send you a leaf. My only doubt is, if the ants really cultivate these sacs, as we cultivate cabbages & turnips, w d . not the saccate leaves become plane even in a few generations? I do not see what influence the secretions of ants c d . have on the Tococas, except in the way of manure.

On the subject of “sexual selection” & “protection” you do not yet convince me that I am wrong,—but I expect your heaviest artillery will be brought up in your 2nd. vol. & I may have to capitulate. You seem however to have somewhat misunderstood my exact meaning, & I do not think the difference between us is quite so great as you seem to think it. There are a number of passages in which you argue against the view, that the female has, in any large number of cases been “specially modified” for protection,—or that colour has generally been obtained by either sex for purposes of protection. But my view is, & I thought I had made it clear, that the female has (in most cases) been simply prevented from acquiring the gay tints of the male (even when there was a tendency for her to inherit it) because it was hurtful;—and, that when protection is not needed, gay colours are so generally acquired by both sexes as to show, that inheritance by both sexes of colour variations is the most usual, when not prevented from acting by nat. selection. The colour itself may be acquired either by sexual selection or by other unknown causes. There are however difficulties in the very wide application you give to sexual selection which at present stagger me, though no one was or is more ready than myself to admit the perfect truth of the principle or the immense importance & great variety of its applications. Your chapters on “Man” are of intense interest,—but as touching my special heresy not as yet altogether convincing, though of course I fully agree with every word and every argument which goes to prove the “evolution” or “development” of man out of a lower form.

The bird would call my sister by name “Henrietta” when he wanted her to give him food—and never applied the same name to another person— He invariably said “Good morning” to every one entering the dining room at breakfast time—and good night to every one as they left the room to go to bed. but he never applied these words improperly— To my father he regularly added to “Good morning”— “how are you old boy”? he never said this to any one else, neither did he ever say it to any one after my father’s death , during the ten years he survived him. He must have associated the words in these cases with certain persons and things. I once heard him repeating in a very excited way from another room. “Go out Sir”— “Go out Sir”— I found a small dog had got into the room through the open window— On one occasion when my father had as usual gone into the dining room at about twelve Oclock to take a glass of ale,—a bottle of which with a tumbler was placed for him on the table—he found the tumbler & part of the ale gone. He said “who has been taking my ale”. the parrot at once said—“Norah”. My sister Norah had just before taken it to give to a person in another room. On another occasion—his cage was in the kitchen & near it another cage with a green parrot. Polly was heard scolding in a very angry tone—“You naughty bird”— “You naughty Polly”— “How dare you Sir”—& violently fluttering his wings; this was caused by the green parrot having got out of his cage and on the kitchen table, where he was feasting on some apples. It is impossible to doubt that he connected in his mind the words he used, with what he knew to be the fault of the other bird. He was very fond of quietly enticing the cat to his cage, by saying in a very gentle voice “puss” “puss “puss”—and then directly the cat came close changing his tone and saying very loudly “go away” “go away Sir” “go away”—and then laughing as the cat ran away. Once when he was saying in a very low gentle voice “pussy” pussy”, a little mouse was in the cage. Some words that he used incorrectly, he yet applied correctly so far as the object being always the same in his mind— For instance he had learnt to associate “kettle boiling with breakfast and consequently with his own food; and if my sister did not give him his bit of bread and butter soon after making the tea, he would repeat “Henrietta, kettle boiling”, till he got it; and as he never used the words except at meal times when he wanted his food, he must have meant by “Kettle boiling”—“Bread and butter”— Hamond has lately been staying with us— I was pointing out to him how singularly like a large squirrel, was a brown dog with pointed head & bushy tail over his back—and how easy it was to suppose that they might have sprung from one stock. He said that he thought foxes were more like squirrels and that in Norfolk there were instances of foxes getting into trees.

B., elder","I hope you will not get quite sick of the sight of my handwriting, but I want you to act as a funnel to your father for so much of my remarks as you may deem suitable. I never like to say all I have to say to him, for fear of tiring him. I feel I have a number of heterogeneous remarks to make some of them probably not worth making, but I sh d like to tumble them all out of my mind. I gave him a little Abstract I had made of what I took for his views on Ethics, & I understood him to say he accepted them entirely so far as all except the self-regarding virtues went. Now I so want him to abolish that distinction between self-regarding & others-regarding virtues. (This is not a criticism of anything in his book only of this remark to me.) It is like the governess’s division of plants into shrubs, bulbous plants & weeds. (the division is much better but I cant get hold of it exactly.) Of course in the police regulations of a nation we have to recognise some sort of distinction of that kind just as a gardener has to recognize the distinction between flowers & weeds, but there is surely no more science in one classification than in the other. I suppose temperance is a typical example of a self-regarding virtue, & yet if drunkenness did not put one out of the way of doing any good to one’s fellow creatures & into the way of doing them a great deal of harm (I suppose no single fact is a larger source of crime) I cannot see what harm there w d be in it. I do so thoroughly feel nothing is self-regarding in that sense. We radiate whatever we are. I wanted to say something about Mr Morley’s letter, which interested me very much —& yet I dont think there was much in it for Uncle Ch. The drift of it seemed to me, as far as I cd take it in without remembering the criticism from which the correspondence took its rise, a vindication of the intellectual character of what we mean by the sense of beauty, as an essential part of what he calls the Association philosophy. It was much as if in some chemical work you shd find some compound spoken of by the name which you wished to keep for one of it’s constituent elements. I shd hardly think it was worth Uncle Ch’s while to attend to a matter of nomenclature like that [1 page or more missing] have them here but how silly to take it amiss that a tea-cup wont hold a gallon!

At p. 19 it runs.—“The platysma myoides which is well developed in the neck (of man) belongs to this system, but cannot voluntarily be brought into action”. Now, like its congener, the “occipito-frontalis” this human muscle can usually be voluntarily brought into action, and in some individuals and families remarkably so. In the lower orders of the Irish and especially in women of that class whose necks are less bound & covered up than in men, the muscle can be seen in bawling & angry gesticulation to raise folds of skin in the neck eminently expressive of disgust & contempt. A portion of it passing over the jaw to the angle of the mouth is called the “risorius Santorini” from being first described by that famous old anatomist It gives rise to the “risus sardonicus” or laughing “at the wrong side of the mouth” as the saying goes,—causing a “ricanante” & lugubrious expression to the mouth, spasmodically affected in tetanus & hydrophobia & which is also to be found remarkably characteristic in horses & dogs. I have found both largely developed in the bodies of Negroes & low caste Lascars whom I have dissected, & in one Chinaman. Both are supplied liberally by the great nerve of expression to the cutaneous muscles of the face,—“the portio dura” I have also found them well developed in monkeys, the Orang & the Chimpanzee I have more readily taken upon myself to set right this little mistake in that you have done me the honor to speak favorably, in your book in question, of my researches upon “ muscular variations in the human subject.

The inclosed photographs are copies of the original photographs taken at the place. They represent the pictures of a man, a woman and a child. The woman is easily recognised by the ring on her finger. An ordinary magnifying glass will convince you at once that these must be photographs taken from living beings. All the facts I have been able to gather about them are the following: Captain Bosse of the British Ship “Sawely Chludow” who left here (New-Orleans) on the 24 th . of May 1871 for Cork Ireland, there to wait for orders, told me the following: He was ordered to go to Bassein on the Bassein-River on the Southwest coast of Birmah to take a cargo of Rice. The vessels go up Bassein-River to the Landing and Lading Place Bassein, where the Rice mills are located, which prepare the rice brought by the natives (in the husks), for shipment. He saw there himself on board of his own vessel, these hairy people, who had brought rice down from the mountains, where this tribe lives in numbers, to sell it at Bassein. A Photographer happened to be on board another English vessel, who took the originals of the pictures, whose copies (taken here in New-Orleans) you find inclosed. He further stated, that they were an amiable, hospitable kind of people, rather advanced in culture and very pleasant to come in contact with. But that now this was or would soon be over as “The missionaries had got amongst them” “Ipsa verba” The wife of Captain Bosse a very intelligent woman (German) has given me a good many details respecting these people, but as they are not pertinent, I have to omit them. Two things are certain to my mind: 1 st . These are the very hairy people we want as one of the connecting links and 2 ly . I have never seen them mentioned before. I own I have hesitated notwithstanding, a good many days, before thus trespassing on you, but in the interest of a branch of science I dearly love and out of regard for a man I so highly estimate, I have run the risk of being intrusive. If this communication has really any value, you would very much oblige an old german Darwinian, by an acknowledgment of its safe reception.

The ♀s are then for the most part heavy with young & would find the occupation of removing the snow very laborious—whilst the ♂s being without horns are unable to resist their fair but well armed assailants— I know that this is at least often the case & think it is probably always so & in fact the main reason of the permanency of the horns.

I cannot find anything that is stable , the greater the material in space and number (age) the more one is adrift to get a correct diagnosis of a genus or a species, and the gradual passage in Echini of the most widely separated groups leaves in my mind but little doubt that our classification is nothing but the most arbitrary convenient tool, depending upon the material at our command at a special time.

B.","It is so stupid to publish well-known facts, that I sh d . be greatly obliged if you would tell me, whether it is known that the glandular hairs of plants have the power of absorption, as well as of excretion.— I had better explain what I have seen. When minute doses of salts of ammonia & of other nitrogenous fluids are given to the glands of Drosera, besides the movement of the tentacles, another change ensues after a time, viz the cells of the glands, (& afterwards of the whole tentacle) which were before filled with limpid purple fluid undergo what I call segregation. That is, little masses of protoplasmic matter are formed, which float in colourless liquid, & undergo incessant changes of form, like Amœbæ. Now Carbonate of Ammonia is absorbed with extraordinary rapidity & causes segregation sometimes in a few seconds or at most in a few minutes. I thought, therefore, that a weak solution of the the Carbonate of A. would be good to test glandular hairs; & I find that the hairs of 2 species of Saxifrage, of Primula sinensis, & of Pelargonium zonale (though the globular heads of the hairs of the latter do not excrete, as far as I can see) all undergo segregation, showing that the Carbonate has been absorbed. With the Pelargonium absorption was evident in 3 minutes. As rain-water contains salts of Ammonia, & as the glandular hairs are infinitely numerous in some cases, as on the Primula, their power of absorption can hardly be quite indifferent in the nutrition of the plant. I find roots of some very few plants, which I have tried, also absorb the Carbonate; & it was truly wonderful to see how rapidly the segregating process ran up the cells of the roots.— There is one other thing I want to bother you about. How are you off for plants of Drosophyllum? Could you lend me one? Now that I have written out my notes I find several points which I ought to have observed in this most perplexing plant. But if you think your plants w d be sure to survive till the summer, they w d then be in a better state for observation. Have you read Galton’s Essay in Fraser? The idea of castes forming spontaneously & the members inter marrying seems quite new; but the more I think of the subject the less possible does it appear to me that the plan could ever be carried out. I sh d also much like to hear, but only if you have leisure, what you think of Greg’s enigmas. It seems to me grand poetry; but he is too Utopian & too full of faith for me to sympathise thoroughly with him. Altogether I have been rather disappointed in the book.

We are happy to know that you confide in our care to get good french translations of your different publications. No doubt the sale of the Descent of Man would have been larger with a more literary translation as that of M. Moulinie, but it is likewise to be considered that it is rather difficult to decide a french scientific man, or a member of our Institute, to translate a book of a foreign celebrity. You know that not only in France but in every country a great many of Naturalists prefer to write books on Darwinisme, signed with their proper name, rather as to give a plain translation of the celebrated original. The subject of the present letter is to inform you that our translation of the “ Emotions ” is advancing slowly, rather too slowly for our interest. M. Pozzi promised to finish his labour of translation before the end of Mai and enable us by this to get the book ready in June or July. We already informed you that we have the translation of the “ Descent of man ” revised by M. E. Barbier, translator of Lubbock’s Early history. There is however no haste to get this new edition ready as we have still a tolerable number of the first edition left, which sells now rather slowly, and will perhaps do so during next summer, as every body in France seems to be frightened for the few months to come. Although I dont partake in these fears, our business is nevertheless exposed to the consequences of it and will no doubt continue for some months more to be flat. We come however to make a new proposal, which is to get your “Relation of your journey on board of the Beagle” translated into french and to publish it in addition and as a complementary volume of your different works already translated. We think that it will not be a very advantageous operation, but it seems to suit our views as well as yours and to be a profitable one for the french public. Before beginning the labor of translation for which we are about to conclude with the said M. E. Barbier, we feel it our duty to get your special consentment, and to be informed if there are not some additions or alterations to be introduced in the text of the english edition of 1870, which we have in hands.

D.","I ought to have written to 〈you〉 long before this, (and have wished to do s〈o〉 but have been prevented by business,) 〈    〉 tell you the fate of my paper on Leaf Arrangement which you were kind enough to communicate to the Royal Society in the early part of this year. The paper was read, but did not meet with the approval of the Referees, and will not appear in the Transactions. I cannot say that I am sorry for th〈i〉s, for I have since met with a number of very striking facts which have shown 〈me〉 the incompleteness and limited applicability of my theory, and have given me I believe more truth and wider ground to go upon. The closeness of th〈e〉 le〈a〉ves 〈    〉 about the perfect 〈regu〉larity 〈    〉 〈  〉ment— The angle of divergence 〈    〉 primary spiral (old style) was 2 7 〈    〉 the seven ranks as vertical). 〈  〉ow 〈    〉 arrangement could not by any mechan〈ical〉 process of condensation have been derived from a two-ranked order. It might, 〈    〉 remote possibility, have come from an alternate 4-ranked order ( 1 4 ), which coul〈d〉 not in reason have been derived from a 2-ranked original; but a 4-ranked order would almost certainly have assumed the crucial arrangement.— Anyhow, the universality of my theory of an original two-ranked order is knocked on the head by the apparition of that 7-ranked Sedum (which I find is abundant on rock work in the garden of a new house here which we have lately moved into). I cannot avoid the conclusion that the seven ranks of that Sedum have an original value of their own, and have not been derived from any simpler or〈d〉er, e〈    〉 Up to the 5 th . 〈of Se〉pte〈mber〉 〈    〉 all the facts that I had obs〈erved〉 〈    〉 favour of my old theory,—th〈  〉 〈    〉 leaf-orders were derived, by 〈    〉 condensation with twist , from an origi〈nal〉 two-ranked order; (—the refractory mors〈  〉 were the presence of 3 ranks of rootlets in Polygonaceæ , 4 in carrot , &c.; the exact or nearly exact ver〈t〉icality of the 3 ranks in sedges &c. the great variety of vertical ranks in the cactus tribe; the origin of whorls of 3, 4, 5 &c; and ot〈he〉rs of less consequence;)—and I had established to my own satisfaction the existence of a separate series of leaf-orders (of which I have nowhere seen mention before), most conspicuous in the heads of the Dipsaca〈ce〉æ manifestly derived by condensation from the crucial order, and therefore giving stro〈n〉g confirmation of the principle of condensation as having played an important part in the history of leaf-order. —But on the 5 th . of September I was scrambling about the old walls of Kidwelly Castle, and plucked a Sedum of whic〈h〉 every shoot had seven steep spiral r〈    〉 by a leap of primar〈y〉 var〈  〉 〈    〉 number of leaf-〈r〉anks. This view is confirmed by an e〈  〉 of specimens of Sedum sexangula〈re 〉 〈    〉 Cambridge Botanical Gardens, 〈w〉here 〈I found〉 the same plant bearing some shoots with six vertical ranks (in whorls of 3) and others with seven oblique ranks (in alternate order), (the obliquity of the latt〈e〉r, as well as the verticality of the former, being due, as I shall show reason for believi〈n〉g, to the conditions of mutual accommodation among the close-packed leaves.) Being thus compelled to entertain the notion of a variability in the original number of leaf-ranks, I find that it explains all the difficulties which resisted former attacks. It explains the astonishing variety of vertical ranks in the cactus tribe, where a new rank may often be seen a〈p〉pearing between two old ones: it explains why Haworthia Viscosa may have three exactly vertical ranks, while Haworthia Pentagona has five: it explain〈s〉 the exact or almost exact verticality 〈o〉f the three ranks in Sedges and 〈    〉 of the five 〈r〉anks in 〈    〉 and some others (though these latter are 〈    〉 well explained by the former theory) 〈    〉 explains why there may be 3 ranks of 〈    〉 on the roots of Polygonaceæ , 4 on those of carrot , and other variations from the preval〈e〉nt 2-ranked form.— Most of these cases certainly demanded some better explanation than the former theory could give. This supposed variability in the number of vertical ranks of leaves would be only of the nature of a multiplication of similar parts, and this (is it not?) is a well-known form of primary variation. A consideration of the probable behaviour of different numbers of vertical ranks under the need of mutual acc〈o〉mmodation and economy of space, will show that we have here a probable explanation of the origin of the various whorled orders (which I once thought might be derived one from another by some effort of condensation, but I have since recognized the difficulty of 〈    〉 I will not consider the 〈    〉 case of a plant with only one 〈    〉 for I do not know that there is any 〈    〉 suggesting that such a form ever exi〈sted〉 Two vertical ranks would first find mutual accommodation in assuming the alternate order 1 2 (Fig. 1.): [DIAG HERE] and this under further condensation with twist (—proneness to twist is well seen in the two ranks of Gasteria spiralis &c.) would give approximations to the more complex orders of the phyllotactic series 1 3 , 2 5 , 3 8 , 5 13 &c., as shown in my former paper: (only a distant approximation to 1 3 , but a close approximation to 2 5 , and the subsequent terms.) In my former paper I supposed that two original ranks might produce two divergent types,— alternate (Fig 1.) and opposite (Fig. 2), and that the oppo〈s〉ite form would pass into the cr 〈  〉 for sake of economy, and, 〈    〉 likely to survive in the ar〈    〉 shown in Fig 2. But 〈    〉 this form (Fig. 2.) does exist 〈    〉 ever〈y〉 〈    〉 of Mesembrianthemum; and I feel th〈at〉 it is not sufficiently explained by what I wrote before. It is the only form which fails to exemplify the principle of economy of space , which I have reason to regard as having played the chief part in the course of natural selection among primary variations of leaf order; and therefore it is natural to regard this simple two-ranked opposite order as the nearest to the original. It is plain that this form would admit of condensation in two ways, either by lateral economy (producing Fig. 1.) or by longitudinal economy (producing the crucial order). But I shall presently show that the crucial order may, with less dislocation, have been derived from a 4-ranked form. Three vertical ranks.— Suppose a 3-ranked form to have appeared as a primary variation from th〈e〉 〈    〉 the three ranks would g〈  〉 〈    〉 by falling into the altern〈ate〉 〈    〉 and if it abandoned the se〈    〉 vertical, it would gain still more by taking the oblique-ranked form (Fig. 4). [DIAG HERE] (These and the following figures are intended to represent the described arrangement as it would appear if unwrapped from the axis and laid flat.) Examples are frequent of 3 ranks with various degrees of obliquity. The oblique 3-ranked form (Fig. 4.) under further condensation would give successively the orders 2 5 , 3 8 , 5 13 , 8 21 &c., just as well as an original order 1 2 would have done. Thus there arises ambiguity concerning the origin of the more complex orders, unless other considerations come in to decide the point. Four vertical ranks (supposing them to appear by primary variation from the 2- or 3-ranked form) would naturall〈y〉 fall into the crucial order (Fig. 〈    〉 without needing to abando〈n〉 their verticality or make any sacrifice, and would produce a form of exceptional stability (though it is one which has become wonderfully condens〈ed〉 in the heads of the Dipsacaceæ. ) 〈Fi〉g. 5. In what cases the crucial order may hav〈e〉 been derived from 4 ranks, and in what from 2, would need great search to say; but if we found one species with the crucial order and an allied species with 5 ranks, we should be inclined to think that the crucial had come from a 4-ranked form, as nearest to the 5-ranked and requiring least violence of primary variation. Five vertical ranks (supposed as a primary variation from 3 or 4) would find lateral economy in the order 2 5 (Fig 6.) and still more if they took a slight obliquity, as in Fig. 7. [DIAG] Under further condensation we should get 3 8 , 〈  〉/13 , 8 21 &c., just 〈    〉 had begun with a 2-ranked or 〈    〉 form. Thus there is a th〈    〉 attaching to the origin of the 〈    〉 Six vertical ranks would accommoda〈te〉 one another by forming whorls of 3. (Fig 〈8.〉 [DIAG HERE] (In any of these arrangements, the neighbouring ranks would get mutual accommodation by fitting alternately in one another’s intervals; and if the whole number of ranks is even , this alternation allows the ranks to retain their verticality, which is one of the striking features in whorled orders, but if the number of ranks is odd, the alternation fails, and it becomes necessary either to sacrifice a little of the economical fit between neighbouring ranks or to abandon their severe verticality. The latter seems the favourite alternative, and thus the odd numbers of ranks take alternat〈e〉 order with obliquity of ranks, and 〈the〉 even numbers take 〈    〉 with verticality of rank〈s)〉 Seven vertical ranks 〈    〉 economical obliquity, in Sedu〈m se〉xang〈ulare〉 with angular divergence 2 7 . Unde〈r〉 further condensation this order would give successively 3 11 , 5 18 , 8 29 , 13 47 &c. Eight vertical ranks would give whorls of 4. Nine would probably give 2 9 (? non-extant). Ten would give whorls of 5, as 〈s〉een in a species of Linaria . Eleven would probably give 2 11 (? non extant) Twelve would give whorls of 6. —I have gone far enough to show my notion of the origin of the whorled orders, viz. that they have been formed directly from 2 or 4 or 6 or 8 or 10 or 12 &c. original vertical ranks,—in short, from the even numbers of vertical ranks, while the alternate orders have been formed from the odd numbers and from the alter〈nate〉 form of the 2-ranked 〈    〉 (The whorled forms ap〈pear〉 〈to have〉 a habit of primary variati〈  〉 〈    〉 the whorled type: thus: maple 〈    〉 horse chestnut , and many other〈s〉, in w〈hich〉 the normal order is crucial, are fo〈  〉 of varying—not to a 3-ranked or 5-ra〈nked〉 alternate order, but to a 6-ranked whorl〈ed〉 order with whorls of 3. So a sedum in whorls of 3 often varies to whorls of 4.) This theory which I now put forward is consistent with all that I know of leaf-orders, but I must confess it abounds in ambiguities, and after my Kidwelly surprise I shall hardly be surprised if I find still more anomalous forms.— My surprise is, that I had nowhere seen mention of this 7-ranked sedum before. (If this theory falls to the ground, I shall be driven to believe that a bud-axis can and will develope a lateral shoot and leaf at any point where there is room for it: but that would be an extravagance akin to despair.) You will perceive 〈    〉 views are, in the main, 〈    〉 my former theory, embra〈  〉 〈    〉 which the former theory failed 〈    〉 They also involve a limitation of the ra〈nge〉 of application of the former theory, rescuin〈g〉 from a forced allegiance a number of ci〈  〉 which were only uncomfortable there. But the former theory is not hereby superseded the evidence in favour of it still stands as valuable as ever: only its domain is rightly restricted by the establishment of a new province on its borders. The principles brought out in the former theory, namely that the advantage of leaf-order belongs to the bud (and similar close-packed forms) and not to the adult leaf,—that the essence of this advantage is ecomony of space,—that economy of space in complex orders has probably been gained by condensation from simpler orders,—these stand firmer than ever. The only new principle required in the new theory is the possibility of different numbers of vertical leaf-ranks originating by a leap of prim〈ary〉 variation,—the possibility of nature acting per〈  〉 If you can spare a few 〈    〉 very much encouraged by 〈    〉 to tell me what you thin〈k〉 〈    〉 of front; but do not 〈    〉 annoyingly on your time an〈d〉 〈    〉 I enclose a copy of the extracts which Stokes sent me from the critici〈sms〉 of the Referees who condemned my pap〈er〉 in case you should care to read them.

I also went over your farm at Beesby; I saw the Cottages. Higgins wanted to write you a long story about one of them but I thought it would save you bother if I wrote. There is one cottage with a man & wife & 3 children with only 2 rooms altogether both on the ground which ought to be cleared away; there is another old Cottage one of a pair that is empty now, but which could be made decent for £15 or £20 and would be an improvement for the family who live in the single cottage. Higgins proposes pulling down the single old Cottage and doing up the other (Hardy your tenant doing something towards it) & moving the family into it. It will be probably necessary to build a pair of cottages in 2 or 3 years but is hardly necessary at present   If you will send me a line I will write to Higgins Your affect son | W. E Darwin"
